1
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,580
Ain't working out for y'all, huh?

2
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,451
- Mars is the god of war, right?
- Planet, too.

3
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,722
I know it's a planet.
But the clue is "Greek god of war."

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,058
Ares.

5
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:40,663
Greeks called him Ares.
Same dude, different name, that's all.

6
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,206
Ares fits. Thanks.

7
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:46,811
It's all good.

8
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:50,510
See, back in middle school and all,
I used to love them myths.

9
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:52,607
That stuff was deep. Truly.

10
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:56,547
You're up.

11
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:09,598
State calls Omar Little, Your Honor.

12
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:14,464
Faggot.

13
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,914
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth...

14
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:27,781
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

15
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,047
I surely do.

16
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:34,388
- State your name for the record.
- Omar Devon Little.

17
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:38,692
- Mr. Little, how old are you?
- About 29, thereabout.

18
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,926
- And where do you live?
- No place in particular, ma'am.

19
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,602
- You're homeless?
- In the wind, so to speak.

20
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:49,673
- And what is your occupation?
- Occupation?

21
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,436
What exactly do you do for a living,
Mr. Little?

22
00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:55,541
I rip and run.

23
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:59,884
- You...
- I robs drug dealers.

24
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:07,019
And exactly how long has this been
your occupation, Mr. Little?

25
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,491
I don't know exactly.

26
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:12,957
I venture to say
maybe about eight or nine years.

27
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,496
Mr. Little, how does a man rob drug dealers
for eight or nine years...

28
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:19,594
and live to tell about it?

29
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,609
Day at a time, I suppose.

30
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,271
What do we know?

31
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:08,745
On Sobotka, very little.
He seems to live within his means.

32
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,484
House in Glen Burnie,
paid-off truck, modest savings.

33
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,611
- Credit history is okay.
- There's no flash to him, nothing dramatic.

34
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:18,815
Doesn't sound much
like a money man to me.

35
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:22,451
- Or maybe he's hiding it.
- The union is also a little threadbare.

36
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,255
They paid the taxes on union hall
almost a year late...

37
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:27,798
and that was only after
they got hit with liens.

38
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,299
Looking at their books--

39
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,836
- You subpoenaed their books?
- You don't need to.

40
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,962
IBS books are open
to the Justice Department...

41
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,200
under the terms
of a federal racketeering case...

42
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:39,243
- that came out of New York five years ago.
- We called Washington.

43
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,837
They sent us a copy of everything
the Baltimore locals have filed.

44
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:45,610
The books show
that there's less than a 100 checkers...

45
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,913
still paying dues to 15-14.

46
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,817
And that's down from about 300 in the '70s.
They're hurting.

47
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:54,692
So where's all this money
Valchek is talking about?

48
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,491
The IBS hired Bruce DiBiago
to lobby Annapolis this session.

49
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:01,031
And through individual officers
and union members...

50
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,966
they've paid about $70,000
to various PACs...

51
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,470
and Democratic organizations
in the last eight months.

52
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,130
They show any of that on their books?

53
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,038
No, we pieced that together
from the campaign finance reports.

54
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:14,943
That's just what was in the names
of the union officers we cross-referenced.

55
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:17,615
- So, where's the cash coming from?
- Drugs?

56
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:22,483
So far, DNRs
on the union hall phones don't show much.

57
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:25,888
Union business and personal calls,
but no beepers...

58
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,390
and not much in the way of cell numbers
or payphones either.

59
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,924
What's with those hand-to-hands?
Anything connect?

60
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,192
We're buying from a lot of white boys.

61
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,929
O'Donnell Heights, Greektown,
Highlandtown above the park.

62
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:42,397
- But any port connections feel random.
- The money comes from somewhere.

63
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,840
Maybe it's what the checkers do.

64
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,580
I mean...

65
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,845
they monitor what comes in
and out of the port.

66
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:56,086
- That's what they do, that's their value.
- They're bringing the shit in?

67
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,719
Or they're letting it happen.

68
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:02,851
Like that can full of dead girls.
They kept that out of the computer.

69
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:06,990
Which is why we're gonna quietly do
some work on that side of things.

70
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:11,263
Kima, Prez,
I want you to start looking at girls.

71
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,136
No problem.

72
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,740
If they're coming into Baltimore,
who's working them?

73
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:20,403
Are they club dancing, whoring?
We need to plug into that circuit.

74
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:22,411
As for the rest of you...

75
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,484
Lester is gonna stay with the paper trail
and with the DNRs...

76
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,677
looking for connections to the union money.

77
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:28,811
Herc and Carver...

78
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,856
you guys keep working the drug corners
near the port.

79
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,288
Officer Russell here and Bunk Moreland
are assigned to Homicide...

80
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,294
but for the time being they'll be with us...

81
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:41,230
running the port database, looking
for any pattern involving contraband.

82
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,658
Questions?

83
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:55,743
Excuse me.

84
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,373
- I'm Thomas.
- Beadie.

85
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,920
Would you like to go to Royal Farms,
maybe get a cup of coffee?

86
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,049
Right.

87
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,919
Yo, I'm Thomas. You want a coffee?

88
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,865
Listen, I was gonna ask her for her panties
to make some soup with...

89
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,562
but I was afraid she'd take it the wrong way.

90
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:24,665
You were at the opposite end
of the parking lot...

91
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,371
- when the assailant drew his gun?
- Thereabout.

92
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,539
Do you see the gunman who killed Mr. Gant
anywhere in the courtroom today?

93
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:34,178
Yo, what up, Bird?

94
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:37,947
For the record, you are identifying
the defendant, Marquis Hilton.

95
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,957
It's just Bird to me.

96
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:44,221
And Mr. Little, you had seen him
many times before, had you not?

97
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:48,797
- Yeah, we jailed together down the Cut--
- Objection, Your Honor. May we approach?

98
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:56,197
Quite a witness, ain't he?

99
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,972
Word on the street is, Omar ain't
nowhere near them rises when the shit pop.

100
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,678
Street said little cocksucker
was over on the East Side...

101
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:10,152
sticking up some Ashland Avenue niggers.

102
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,417
That's the word on the street, huh?

103
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,724
Trouble is, String, we ain't on the street.
We're in a court of law.

104
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,725
Your Honor--

105
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,463
Objection is noted and preserved
for the record, Mr. Levy. Move on.

106
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,329
Thank you, Your Honor.

107
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,809
Jurors will disregard that last comment
from the witness in which he explained...

108
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,778
where he had last
encountered the defendant.

109
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,972
Yes or no, Mr. Little?

110
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,880
Prior to the shooting,
did you know the defendant?

111
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,484
I knew the man,
but wasn't like he was no friend or nothing.

112
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,491
So you would have no trouble
recognizing him from a moderate distance...

113
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,061
say 20, 25 yards in daylight?

114
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:52,120
No problem.

115
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:55,225
Mr. Little, do you recognize...

116
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:57,995
this particular weapon?

117
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,099
Yeah, that's Bird's gun, the .380.

118
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:02,867
- You've seen it before?
- Bird always flashing that thing.

119
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,944
So you'd actually seen it
before the day in question.

120
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,481
- And on the day in question?
- It was in Bird's hand.

121
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,649
- When he shot at Mr. Gant?
- Yes, ma'am.

122
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:19,045
- Bird covet them shiny little pistols.
- Objection, Your Honor.

123
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,887
And the boy too trifling to throw it off
even after a daytime murder.

124
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:26,931
You're a lying cocksucker, man.
I'll rip your heart out your goddamn chest!

125
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:30,433
The defendant will regain control
or he will be forcibly restrained...

126
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,265
and I will clear the court.

127
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:36,273
The witness's last answer is to be stricken
and disregarded by the jury.

128
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:42,113
Niko.

129
00:09:45,617 --> 00:09:46,982
Eton is my friend.

130
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,455
It's good to have friends meet, no?

131
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,815
Eton, huh?

132
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:55,649
That's from the Greek, meaning what?

133
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:57,853
No Greek. Israeli.

134
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:00,498
Yeah?

135
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,097
'Cause you look Greek, no offense.

136
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,004
Either way, I mean...

137
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,446
- You have the chemicals?
- I can get them, as much as you want.

138
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,218
When?

139
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:24,253
I was gonna do something this week.
There's been a problem, though.

140
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:27,649
- What problem?
- My cousin Ziggy.

141
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:31,756
He got into a beef
with these East Baltimore guys.

142
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,799
Drug dealer by the name of Cheese
took his car, burned it...

143
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,892
now he's saying he's gonna dust Zig
if he doesn't pay.

144
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:43,773
Yeah, malaka, right.
Zig fucked up the package.

145
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,779
So, you bring us the chemicals, we pay.

146
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,172
Then you pay your debt.

147
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,784
It was $2,700, right?

148
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,957
Now, this asshole is saying it's double.
$5,400, you believe that?

149
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:02,926
First he takes the car...

150
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:05,428
and now he's jacking us around
on the money.

151
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:08,796
- You want, we kill him.
- No.

152
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,668
- That ain't it either, no.
- Why no?

153
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,840
'Cause first of all, Zig fucked it up.
He owes $2,700.

154
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,969
And second, you kill Cheese...

155
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,605
and we're gonna have a fight
with his people, right?

156
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:24,875
A year down the road...

157
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:27,577
some nigger sees my cousin
coming out the burger shop...

158
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:31,850
putting gas in his car on Central Avenue,
no questions, puts a cap in his ass.

159
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,721
He's smart, huh? Niko, smart.

160
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:44,368
We don't have the muscle
to go talk to this guy, make things right.

161
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,299
I was hoping maybe you do.

162
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,243
Mr. Little...

163
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,807
can I ask why you came forward
in this case?

164
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:01,547
- I told the police what I know.
- Were you offered anything in exchange?

165
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,753
- Like what?
- Were you arrested?

166
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,150
Were you going to be charged with a crime,
and by testifying...

167
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,752
did the police agree to drop those charges?

168
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,457
No, man, it ain't even about that.

169
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,764
How many times have you been arrested
as an adult, Mr. Little?

170
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,566
Shoot, I done lost count.

171
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,499
Enough, though, not to take it personal.

172
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,304
Possession of a handgun...

173
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,371
possessing a concealed weapon,
assault by pointing...

174
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:33,576
robbery, deadly weapon,
possession of a handgun again...

175
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:37,050
followed by violation of parole
on weapon charges...

176
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,950
followed by
one count of attempted murder...

177
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:42,720
and use of a handgun
in commission of a felony.

178
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,295
That wasn't no attempt murder.

179
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,393
What was it, Mr. Little?

180
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,569
I shot the boy Mike-Mike
in his hind parts, that all.

181
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,305
Fixed it so he couldn't sit right.

182
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,734
Why'd you shoot Mike-Mike
in his hind parts?

183
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:04,239
- Let's say we had a disagreement.
- A disagreement over?

184
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,580
Mike-Mike thought he should keep
that cocaine he was slinging...

185
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,553
and the money
he was making from slinging it.

186
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,385
I thought otherwise.

187
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,329
So you rob drug dealers?
This is what you do.

188
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,491
Yes, sir.

189
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,500
You walk the streets of Baltimore
with a gun...

190
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,036
taking what you want, when you want it...

191
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,902
willing to use violence
when your demands aren't met.

192
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:30,736
This is who you are.

193
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,175
Why should we believe
your testimony then?

194
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,875
- Why believe anything you say?
- That's up to y'all, really.

195
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,687
You say you aren't here
testifying against the defendant...

196
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:45,916
- because of any deal you made with police.
- True that.

197
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:48,993
That you are here
because you want to tell the truth...

198
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,427
about what happened to Mr. Gant
in that housing project parking lot.

199
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,555
Yup.

200
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,725
When in fact you are exactly
the kind of person who would...

201
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,564
if you felt you needed to...

202
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,968
shoot a man down
on a housing project parking lot...

203
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,507
and then lie to the police about it,
would you not?

204
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,510
Look, I ain't never put my gun on no citizen.

205
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:09,875
You are amoral, are you not?

206
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:14,549
You are feeding off the violence
and the despair of the drug trade.

207
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:19,020
You are stealing from those who themselves
are stealing the lifeblood from our city.

208
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:22,287
- You are a parasite who leeches off...
- Just like you, man.

209
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,988
...the culture of drugs... Excuse me? What?

210
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:29,534
I got the shotgun. You got the briefcase.

211
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,894
It's all in the game, though, right?

212
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,306
And with the economy, what it is...

213
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,403
you can really consider coming in
10% or 20% below asking...

214
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,776
and still feel competitive.

215
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:47,010
- Even on the Hamburg Street address?
- Absolutely.

216
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,883
I have to admit, I like the house at 1501.

217
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:52,650
Although I didn't like the color
of the whirlpool tub...

218
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,692
in the master suite bathroom. Magenta?

219
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,421
- That's cosmetic.
- If they want to make the sale...

220
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,225
they should have some amount
of couth to change the color.

221
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,732
I know it's such a tiny point to harp on.

222
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,504
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we should just keep looking.

223
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,539
We shouldn't settle for just anything.

224
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,508
And you think that there will be
some new open houses this Sunday?

225
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:15,409
- I'm sorry, what were you saying?
- We're gonna keep looking.

226
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,972
- You'll take us around again on Sunday?
- Definitely.

227
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:22,515
- Okay then, see you Sunday, early.
- Great.

228
00:15:24,656 --> 00:15:25,953
Thank you.

229
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,418
I'll see you then.

230
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,898
You are a child, you know that?

231
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,492
- What do you want?
- Dinner and a movie.

232
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:42,040
- Come on, stop it.
- Why not?

233
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,169
This isn't going anywhere, Jimmy.

234
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,608
Dinner and a movie,
then I'll walk you to the door...

235
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:50,045
and you tell me to go fuck myself
like you should've done way back when.

236
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:52,742
How about I tell you to fuck yourself
here and now?

237
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,842
Then you can save that money
for someone else.

238
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:58,286
Come on, Elena.
Come on, I signed all your damn papers.

239
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,490
Give me another shot.

240
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,358
Friday. You pay for the sitter.

241
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:21,211
- So how that D.C. game, man?
- Same as it ever was.

242
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,405
Chocolate City, I ain't been there in a while.

243
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,643
Call it Drama City nowadays.

244
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:30,615
Otherwise, same old gogo. Same old Bamas.

245
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:34,382
Same soup, just reheated,
know what I'm saying?

246
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,619
If you need anything to make this happen,
you gotta get it yourself.

247
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,595
I can't go through my people.

248
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,961
If Stringer Bell reaching
all the way past Baltimore...

249
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,536
with this kind of work...

250
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,606
then we got a real mystery
going on, don't we?

251
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:53,772
Don't worry, no mistakes.
Nothing that might come back on you.

252
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,780
- You sure of your people?
- My cousin up in there...

253
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:58,944
- he on it.
- All right.

254
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,916
I can't stand that gogo shit, anyhow.

255
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,484
Ain't heard it live, then.

256
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,816
I know a club in Oxon Hill
that would wreck y'all.

257
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:09,985
All right.

258
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:14,121
If I'm around the way.

259
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,668
So, how you doing?

260
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:22,031
- Nursing school right now.
- Good, that's good.

261
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,334
Lester's been pushing me, you know.

262
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,944
He does it, kind of without you knowing
that he's doing it.

263
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:29,809
Yeah, I know what you mean.

264
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,982
He said that you would be by today
to talk about the clubs.

265
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:35,052
About some girls, Russian.

266
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,779
- Or from that part of the world.
- The ones on the circuit, yeah.

267
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,859
You should try this place called Nightshift
down off of Holabird.

268
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,552
I have a friend who works there.

269
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,223
She worked with a bunch of Russian girls
last year for about three months.

270
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,130
- Think she'll talk to me?
- Only if I ask her.

271
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:53,200
Thank you, Detective, nothing further.

272
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,797
- Anything more on redirect, Miss Nathan?
- No, Your Honor.

273
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,502
Let's take 10 minutes
and then run the closing arguments.

274
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,704
I have every intention
of beginning tomorrow...

275
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:03,405
with jury instructions.

276
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,750
- How'd Omar do?
- You didn't see it?

277
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:13,220
Not the cross. That bad?

278
00:19:06,444 --> 00:19:09,504
- You have no problem.
- No?

279
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:13,576
To start, he wants you to pay $5,400.
Then we talk.

280
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:17,844
- He says, "No, you pay just the $2,700."
- Yeah, I saw how you talked.

281
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,017
But you will not pay the $2,700.

282
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:24,152
Instead you will get the money
for the car that burned.

283
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,591
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

284
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:32,262
Him we don't know.
But the one he calls boss, him we know.

285
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,939
You gonna sit there and pout?

286
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:49,344
I know you don't think I'm going down
to that club just to look at pussy.

287
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,445
I know you know me better than that.

288
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,024
- I ain't even looking.
- Everybody's looking.

289
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,999
- Most of them women are dykes.
- Cheryl, it's police work.

290
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,500
What, so that's supposed
to make me feel better?

291
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,834
Kima's out on the street
doing her detective thing?

292
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:13,408
All that hospital shit, all that rehab...

293
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,870
- all them promises--
- We talked about this.

294
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,472
No, you talked.

295
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:22,318
I didn't get a word in edgewise
once you made up your mind.

296
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,530
- Where you going?
- With you.

297
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:39,360
Excuse me?

298
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,963
Who knows? I might see a little something
I happen to like.

299
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:45,809
So all of that's on the table?

300
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,572
There's money in the transport budget
for the grain pier.

301
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,171
Also, a bond issue that pays
for maintenance dredging...

302
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:52,442
on the main shipping channel.

303
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,178
- But not the canal?
- Nope, not the canal.

304
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,517
For that we'll have to fight
a little longer and dig a little deeper.

305
00:20:58,623 --> 00:20:59,851
So says Frank.

306
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,155
I gotta say, for my money,
we're lucky if we pull out the grain pier.

307
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:06,526
Be that as it may,
we spent the money and took our best shot.

308
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:09,429
Hired a couple lobbyists,
made some smart contributions...

309
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,865
paid for a consultant's report...

310
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,130
to argue against
some of the environmental stuff.

311
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,229
It cost, but we're starting to see it.

312
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,276
- So where y'all find the cash?
- I've been robbing liquor stores, two a week.

313
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,138
Seriously.

314
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,771
We got some help
from the national office on this.

315
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:27,181
There've been some timely donations
from a few friends here and there.

316
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:29,116
The point is, at the very least...

317
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,814
we're likely to see
the grain pier back up by next year...

318
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,619
which means a couple hundred
more ships a year, at least.

319
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,751
- If.
- And it's a big fucking "if."

320
00:21:36,861 --> 00:21:38,988
- If that Polack motherfucker--
- Hey.

321
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,954
No offense.

322
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:45,068
If Krawczyk don't fuck us by throwing up
waterfront condominiums first, right?

323
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,936
Nat's right. The back door threat
is that Andy Kraw or some other developer...

324
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,441
gets enough last-minute votes
to sink the rehab money for the grain pier.

325
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,569
Those guys are looking at that location, too.

326
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:56,874
So we need everybody making phone calls.

327
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:59,643
Let your legislators know
that we're watching on this.

328
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:03,551
The money only goes so far.
Now we gotta make some noise, right?

329
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,151
- Make some noise.
- Okay, enough talk.

330
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:08,316
Some of youse got ships
to work in the morning.

331
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:11,554
- The rest of youse need to be drunk.
- I'll drink to that.

332
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:23,898
Help from the national office, huh?
Timely donations from friends?

333
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,307
Watch your ass, Frank.

334
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:33,576
- This is it?
- Yeah.

335
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,778
Just picked it up
from the port administrator.

336
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,218
So what am I looking at?

337
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:40,655
The Atlantic Light on the day
the can with the women was offloaded.

338
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,624
The boxes are containers.

339
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:45,792
This one's being offloaded
and set on a chassis.

340
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,397
Here's the time: 10:31 hours.

341
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,337
See? It was moved to Lane L,
Stack 6, Row 3...

342
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,532
by an RTG at 10:37 hours.

343
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,137
- RTG?
- Rubber tire gantry.

344
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:03,144
So from ship to stack took six minutes.

345
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,109
That's the way it's supposed to work, but...

346
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:08,515
"AQQZ," as in zebra...

347
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:11,416
"396594."

348
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,218
Check digit, seven.

349
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,026
That's the container number
of the can with the women in it.

350
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:19,119
See that?
It was never entered by the checker.

351
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,290
So as far as the computer is concerned,
it no longer exists.

352
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,336
Sobotka says that that can happen
when the radio waves get knocked down...

353
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:29,229
or when a checker inputs
a bad serial number.

354
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:33,140
It came off Atlantic Light at 11:26 hours.

355
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:36,680
And it doesn't show up
in the computer again until 15:12 hours.

356
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:38,849
I find it two hours after that.

357
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:43,650
So for nearly four hours,
it's out on the docks, unaccounted for.

358
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:46,817
Sobotka says cans get lost all the time.

359
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,621
When they get found,
they get put back into the computer.

360
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:51,285
You believe him?

361
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,725
No, not this can.

362
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,300
So what's the plan?

363
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,732
The database on this computer...

364
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,237
has records for every ship
that berthed at Patapsco...

365
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,931
over the last two years.

366
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,635
We gotta go back through
and find what other cans...

367
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:07,233
might've disappeared like that.

368
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,610
- See if there's a pattern.
- How many ships we talking about?

369
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:13,816
Hundreds.

370
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:20,116
It ain't like I got a prayer of bringing
this case in otherwise.

371
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:27,256
- That's what I'm talking about.
- All right.

372
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,727
- What the hell is your problem?
- Nothing.

373
00:24:30,835 --> 00:24:33,736
Yeah, you look like you about to be sick
or something.

374
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:35,829
I just can't look at them.

375
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,343
Prez, you ain't never been to a titty bar?

376
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:42,810
Yeah, sure. But not with women.

377
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:46,241
You're sure you're not gonna have
a problem for talking to us?

378
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:50,151
I don't give a shit.
You friends with Shardene, all that matters.

379
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:53,553
Besides, I'm from Westport,
and I told them club owners straight-up...

380
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,319
I was here before them ho's got here...

381
00:24:55,426 --> 00:24:57,758
and they better make sure
I'm here after they leave.

382
00:24:57,862 --> 00:25:02,231
- So how long ago did they came through?
- Six months back was the last batch.

383
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,063
Russians, I think,
but shit all sound the same...

384
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:07,296
when you can't understand
a damn word, right?

385
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:11,000
- Who brought them?
- Club owner pays extra for them.

386
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,802
There was a woman...

387
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,970
she was like the madam
who handled the cash.

388
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:17,604
- But I ain't get a name.
- She Russian, too?

389
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:20,411
She was something. She had an accent.

390
00:25:20,952 --> 00:25:24,183
So it's like, one day all Baltimore girls
are at the bar...

391
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,779
and the next, what?

392
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,324
- All foreign girls?
- That about right.

393
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,758
They was making so much money
with them new girls...

394
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,887
they let some of their regular dancers go.

395
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:35,522
Not me, 'cause I mean, I got clientele here.

396
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,795
- But some of the others...
- Where'd the girls stay?

397
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:42,569
Where they told. Shit, they ain't here legally.
They don't know shit.

398
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,073
They ain't got no family.

399
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,905
The men they got handling them
are always with them.

400
00:25:47,011 --> 00:25:49,536
Right there to take them
from whatever motel they use...

401
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:50,978
to the club and back.

402
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,880
Right there when they need to get food,
or go to the Rite Aid.

403
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:57,512
Right outside the motel door
when they up in them rooms with the johns.

404
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,419
Anyone try to get away?

405
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,058
Shit, I seen one of them get lit up
with one of them stun guns...

406
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,186
for going down the block
to get some dinner.

407
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:08,493
They barely let them girls
go to the bathroom by themselves.

408
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,124
And if they see one getting
too close to the johns...

409
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:13,863
that's when they move the whole crew
to another town.

410
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,304
Keep it so they don't get no help.

411
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:19,432
You up after the next song.

412
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,672
Push my numbers then.
I gotta go get paid, honey.

413
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:27,044
You need anything else, you can call me.
Help if I can.

414
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:29,511
I'll tell Shardene you said hi.

415
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,084
She must be doing good,
to be out for so long.

416
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,918
She must've landed a rich one, right?

417
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,093
- You her girl?
- Yeah.

418
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:43,594
I wouldn't let mine come in here either
without me.

419
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:46,431
These bitches in here are no joke.

420
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,007
Thirteen of them.

421
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:10,080
They had about a third of that space
hidden behind the fake wall.

422
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:14,385
A few flashlights, some junk food,
some water.

423
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,657
A portable toilet they had to share.

424
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:21,788
And not enough air.

425
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,942
I'm going to schedule sentencing
for the third week of next month.

426
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,521
Anything else today?

427
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:48,525
Your Honor, my client,
having preserved the necessary grounds...

428
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:51,595
for appeal in the record,
wishes me to state unequivocally...

429
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,493
that regardless of this jury's verdict...

430
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:57,261
he is the victim of wholesale perjury
on the part of the state's key witness.

431
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,233
We ask that an appeal bond be set...

432
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,897
so that he can participate fully
in this investigation.

433
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,440
An appeal bond on a conviction
of first-degree murder?

434
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,840
- Mr. Levy, get a grip on yourself.
- Your Honor--

435
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,742
Not only will there be
no bond pending sentencing...

436
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:11,439
but as far as I'm concerned...

437
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,143
the pre-sentencing report
is a mere formality.

438
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:18,245
Mr. Hilton has been found guilty
of killing a state's witness...

439
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,916
who testified in this very courtroom.

440
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:24,185
He did so in cold blood, and for pay.

441
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:27,562
Unless the pre-sentence report
indicates that he is, in fact...

442
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,155
the Messiah come again...

443
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,259
he will very likely be sentenced
to life, no parole...

444
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,930
by a Baltimore judge who,
for once in his life...

445
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,065
gets to leave his office feeling
that his job actually matters.

446
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,974
Mr. Hilton, are you the second coming
of our savior?

447
00:29:41,078 --> 00:29:44,013
- Excuse me?
- Are you Jesus Christ come back to Earth?

448
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,047
See you at sentencing.

449
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:57,426
Was it good for you, too?

450
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,593
Mr. Little, this is good to get-out-of-jail-free
one time only...

451
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,191
on anything up to aggravated assault.

452
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,905
- Why thank you, ma'am.
- No, thank you.

453
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,002
A rare pleasure.

454
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:17,074
Time for the ceremonial eyefuck.

455
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:19,615
Come see me down the Cut,
you punk-ass snitch.

456
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:22,208
I'll shove a shiv down
your cocksucking throat!

457
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,617
You think on it, Bird.

458
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:25,780
You think on Brandon
while you doing that time?

459
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,554
I'm gonna see you, man, I swear to God!
Fuck that, I'll do you like a dog.

460
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:32,720
You really see him shoot the man?

461
00:30:34,565 --> 00:30:35,930
You really asking?

462
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:44,899
But it's fucked because the man
got to where he needed to be...

463
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,208
and she wasn't even worth it.

464
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:50,845
Daisy wasn't nothing past any other bitch,
anyway, you know?

465
00:30:50,948 --> 00:30:55,783
And he did all that for her and in the end,
it ain't amount to shit.

466
00:30:56,887 --> 00:31:00,414
Fitzgerald said that
there were no second acts in American lives.

467
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,522
- Do you believe that?
- Man, shit, we locked up.

468
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,392
We best not believe that, right?

469
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,764
He's saying that the past is always with us.

470
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:12,595
And where we come from,
what we go through...

471
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:15,934
how we go through it, all that shit matters.

472
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:20,636
- I mean, that's what I thought he meant.
- Go ahead.

473
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:27,177
Like at the end of the book, you know?
Boats and tides and all.

474
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:30,780
It's like you can change up, right?

475
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:34,449
You can say you're somebody new,
you can give yourself a whole new story...

476
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,960
but what came first is who you really are...

477
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:41,393
and what happened before
is what really happened.

478
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:44,966
And it don't matter
that some fool say he different...

479
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,367
'cause the only thing
that can make you different...

480
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:49,735
is what you really do
or what you really go through.

481
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,207
Like, you know,
like all them books in his library.

482
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,944
Now, he fronting with all them books...

483
00:31:57,848 --> 00:32:01,978
but if we pull one down off the shelf,
ain't none of the pages ever been opened.

484
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,815
He got all them books,
and he ain't read near one of them.

485
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:12,022
Gatsby, he was who he was,
and he did what he did...

486
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,589
and 'cause he wasn't ready
to get real with the story...

487
00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:21,166
that shit caught up to him.

488
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,298
I think, anyway.

489
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:42,991
Sorry, homey.

490
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:50,227
You done with your trial?

491
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:54,434
- All right then, let's take her on out.
- Tomorrow.

492
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:58,165
- I'm back with you tomorrow, Diggsy.
- You got something else to do today?

493
00:32:58,275 --> 00:33:00,038
Yeah, last bit of business.

494
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:04,437
- This is your business.
- This is retirement.

495
00:33:05,182 --> 00:33:07,275
And after today, I'm retired.

496
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,963
Talk when I say, not before.

497
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:33,438
- Tovarich.
- Serge, my nigger.

498
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,504
- You're losing weight.
- Shit.

499
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,242
You are down to nothing.

500
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,251
In this country, supermarkets are cathedrals.

501
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,587
- I worry for you, buddy.
- How your peoples, dog?

502
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:47,520
Same, good.

503
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:50,057
You talk to the man
about that other thing, right?

504
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,686
Because I can get behind
that business in a big way.

505
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:56,563
- We will talk later. Now, another business.
- Right.

506
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,993
This the man with the raggedy-ass Camaro?

507
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:03,934
Wasn't mine, it was my cousin's.
It wasn't all that raggedy.

508
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:11,646
Sorry. Nicky is with us. His cousin...

509
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,947
But family cannot be helped.

510
00:34:15,252 --> 00:34:16,412
Who you telling?

511
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,889
I got motherfucking nephews and in-laws
fucking all my shit up all the time.

512
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:25,289
And it ain't like I can pop a cap in their ass
and not hear about it Thanksgiving time.

513
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:29,025
For real, I'm living life
with some burdensome niggers.

514
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,899
So what the fuck?

515
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:39,601
You ain't pay my boy Cheese,
and Cheese ain't paying me, right?

516
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:42,234
I ain't talking
about all the money in the world.

517
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:45,440
But it ain't like Cheese be in a position
out on that corner...

518
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:48,484
to let your cuz exemplify shit, you feel?

519
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:50,619
The man cut you some slack...

520
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:53,155
and soon every fucking-up white boy
be on his titty.

521
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,192
We wanna pay what we owe.
The $2,700 anyway.

522
00:34:56,393 --> 00:34:59,419
- We're gonna have it soon enough.
- Your man doubled it, though.

523
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,122
He also burned the car.

524
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,826
Now the blue book
on that Camaro was $5,100.

525
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,267
Now, let me understand.

526
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:10,765
You gonna come up in here,
having fucked up a package...

527
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,942
asking me to tell Cheese,
who you fucked it up on...

528
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:16,238
to pay you out $2,400.

529
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:19,544
He gets to keep the Camaro.

530
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,220
Just how good a friend
is this motherfucker to y'all?

531
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:31,152
The Cheese ain't gonna be happy
having to pay me back...

532
00:35:31,328 --> 00:35:34,786
so I would advise y'all
to give him some distance.

533
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:38,532
Just so he don't come back on my cousin.

534
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,871
Anyway, thanks for being straight on this.

535
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,202
Fool, if it wasn't for Serge here...

536
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,838
you and your cuz both would
be cadaverous motherfuckers.

537
00:35:56,887 --> 00:36:00,789
I went through INS, customs,
even the State Department. Nothing.

538
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:05,886
It's time, Jimmy.
You did what you could, right?

539
00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:17,801
Yeah, fuck it, let her go.

540
00:36:18,842 --> 00:36:21,743
This one to the anatomy board
in the morning.

541
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,407
Jane Doe on the paperwork.

542
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:29,451
- Ain't right, Doc.
- What the fuck ever is?

543
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,352
You leave it to Avon...

544
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,996
he's gonna get some years
off your sentence.

545
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,725
No doubt, knowing Avon.

546
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,797
It's all good, D.

547
00:36:47,404 --> 00:36:50,931
Just show up,
and say what Levy tells you to.

548
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,742
What the hell is wrong with you?

549
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,505
I'm asking you.

550
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:01,210
Those hot shots, that was Avon.

551
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:07,018
I want you home, D.

552
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:10,458
You asked me to carry this. I'm carrying it.

553
00:37:10,694 --> 00:37:13,925
- This is mine, right here, right now.
- Boy, you ain't listening to me.

554
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,658
- I am telling you--
- Ma.

555
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,129
You remember we used
to lived on Linden Avenue?

556
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:20,703
Remember that house?

557
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,167
I was about 6 or 7 years old.

558
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,508
I was playing on the porch.

559
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:32,643
Them twins came by,
started picking on me, messing with me.

560
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,546
Remember that?

561
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,016
I'm banging on the door,
trying to get inside...

562
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,786
and you standing right there
to open the door...

563
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,293
except you ain't letting me inside.

564
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,922
You told me to go back out there
and fight them...

565
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:50,591
whether I lose or not.

566
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:52,769
Remember?

567
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:58,399
- They beat the shit out of you.
- Yeah.

568
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,206
Then you say to me:

569
00:38:01,311 --> 00:38:05,179
"Boy, I might have brung you
into this world...

570
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,585
"but you the one
who gonna have to live in it."

571
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:12,048
Ma, I'm still here.

572
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:16,589
Me. You gotta let me live like I need to live.

573
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:21,764
You tell Avon, Stringer, and Donette...

574
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:24,657
all of them, to leave me be.

575
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:04,369
All right, look, fuck y'all. I need a drink.

576
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,502
- Come on, we're almost through 2002.
- No.

577
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:13,241
- Tomorrow is another goddamn day, right?
- Yeah.

578
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:27,621
They look thirsty, a round on me.

579
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:30,427
Yo, Mr. Sobotka,
friend to the working man...

580
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,967
master of the game.

581
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:35,030
How many votes we get down
in Annapolis tonight, Frankie?

582
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:38,040
- Been here long?
- Since my hair was brown.

583
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:40,540
I was telling Chess about Benny.

584
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,771
- Benny with the harelip?
- That's a good one.

585
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,815
See, Benny was working the hole
and he got hit with a shackle.

586
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,749
Chunk of steel clocked him good,
but he didn't tell nobody.

587
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:50,479
Not until he came in here.

588
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:53,317
That's when Little Nose told Benny
to call the union lawyer.

589
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:54,754
- Paul Sevel?
- Yeah.

590
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:56,223
God rest his soul.

591
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:57,653
So Benny calls Paul.

592
00:39:57,761 --> 00:40:00,787
"Me been hit with a 'ackerel," Benny says.

593
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,229
"A mackerel?

594
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:04,232
"You working frozen foods again?"
Paul says.

595
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:07,861
"No, 'oddamn it, a 'ackerel."

596
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,765
Then he slams the phone down.

597
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:13,604
"'Other'ucker on 'is way over 'ere.

598
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,871
"Says he can't undertan' me."

599
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,974
Little Nose says, "Why he wanna do that?

600
00:40:19,082 --> 00:40:21,744
"Benny don't talk
no fucking better in person."

601
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:29,020
So that's it? Me and Cheese are straight?

602
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,683
Yeah, you're straight.

603
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:33,790
That there's $2,400 for Princess.

604
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,063
She was worth more than that.

605
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,368
Dolo. One for the bar, hon.

606
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:42,768
You win the lotto?

607
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:46,172
If my old man can do it,
who the hell says I can't?

608
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:53,514
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Nick, when I'm flush, I'm flush.

609
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,879
- We ain't gonna live forever, right?
- Next round's on me.

610
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:06,521
- Not for me, I'm gonna head out.
- Come on, Frank, belly up.

611
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,596
Take a rain check.

612
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:18,332
- And that one as well, huh?
- Makes 22.

613
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:22,069
All on the Talco line.
All with Horseface Pakusa working the ship.

614
00:41:22,212 --> 00:41:25,875
- We're on it then.
- You gonna call Bunk?

615
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,209
Detective Moreland is indisposed.

616
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,660
- You with Daniels and them?
- No.

617
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,127
We just parked the computer down there.
We're orphaned, man.

618
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,231
- Orphaned?
- Yeah.

619
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:51,170
Rawls is talking like...

620
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,403
if I don't come home with 14 clearances...

621
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:59,239
I can't come home at all. Lester, too.

622
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,748
Where's the love, Jimmy?

623
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:07,182
Where is the motherfucking love?

624
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,542
- So what's up with you, man?
- Nothing.

625
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:31,341
Nothing, huh?

626
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,686
I'm done, Bunk.
Bird is my last piece of old business.

627
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:39,181
I got nothing new.

628
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:43,121
I was trying for an ID on this one...

629
00:42:45,629 --> 00:42:47,529
and I can't even tell you why.

630
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,298
Just a way to pretend
I was still a murder police, I guess.

631
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,664
Who gives a fuck, right?

632
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,510
Elena and I are gonna try again.

633
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,006
Shit.

634
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:12,179
I'm done fucking myself up, Bunk.
I am done.

635
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,826
Come on, man, let's go home.

636
00:43:20,797 --> 00:43:22,355
All right, man.

637
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:35,206
Over here, shitbird.

638
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,352
What the hell happened to you?

639
00:43:45,455 --> 00:43:48,185
- I fell down.
- How many times?

640
00:43:52,562 --> 00:43:53,688
Let's walk.

641
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,697
- Pop, I'm--
- Walk with me, Zig.

642
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:05,039
Votes break for us,
that pier comes back online by next spring.

643
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:09,009
- More ships, more work.
- Yeah, great.

644
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,947
- What the fuck are you about?
- What?

645
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,987
Is that my son lighting
hundred dollar bills like an asshole...

646
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,081
in a bar full of working stiffs?

647
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:25,227
- What the fuck is that?
- Just a smile.

648
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,230
- A smile?
- Yep, a smile.

649
00:44:31,968 --> 00:44:35,199
You wanna hit me again, Pop,
go ahead, take a shot.

650
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:41,068
Where you come by that kind of cash?
You know you ain't had the days.

651
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,645
Definitely not.

652
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,072
It's 'cause my father's in the union.
Fuck that.

653
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,519
Seniority prevails, Zig.

654
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:53,953
- It's the only way to keep it halfway honest.
- I know, I ain't complaining.

655
00:44:54,057 --> 00:44:58,016
I wish I could give you more.
You don't think I want to throw you more?

656
00:44:58,161 --> 00:45:00,925
- You throw plenty.
- It's just, Christ, Zig.

657
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:04,125
If I'd listened to your mother,
she's the one always talking about--

658
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,223
It's cool.

659
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,462
You should do community college
like your brother.

660
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,402
Pop, don't.

661
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:14,439
You wanna know what I remember?

662
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:16,572
Do you?

663
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:22,249
I remember you, and Uncle Jerry...

664
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:24,444
and Uncle Walt Pe-Pop...

665
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:30,656
all sitting around the kitchen table,
talking shit about this gang and that gang...

666
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:33,057
who's better with the break-bulk...

667
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:36,564
who could turn it around faster, who's lazy.

668
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:41,328
- Always a fucking argument, right?
- Four Polacks, six opinions.

669
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:47,207
I remember when youse all
went down to picket them scabs...

670
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:49,005
at Covington Piers...

671
00:45:49,312 --> 00:45:52,406
how Jackie Taylor got run over
by a police car...

672
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:55,280
in the middle of that whole goddamn mess.

673
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,747
I remember when the Paceco
fell during that windstorm.

674
00:45:58,855 --> 00:46:01,881
You remember, right? Killed Fat Rick dead.

675
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:04,657
Yeah, what else you remember?

676
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,593
Everything.

677
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:24,169
So tell me, Mr. "Back In The Day"...

678
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:27,981
what are we doing down here
with the wharf rats...

679
00:46:28,084 --> 00:46:30,416
in the middle of the goddamn night?

680
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,181
Beats the fuck outta me.

681
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:43,030
Every one of those Post-its
is a can that disappears...

682
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,395
when it's being offloaded.

683
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,799
The yellow slips, they show up again...

684
00:46:46,903 --> 00:46:49,167
with legitimate cargo intact
and are re-entered...

685
00:46:49,272 --> 00:46:51,206
so you figure those are honest mistakes.

686
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:54,038
But the pink and the green,
those cans never come back.

687
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,839
They stay out of the computer for good.

688
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:58,210
And the pink one,
like the can full of dead girls...

689
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,545
they're all from
the same shipping line, Talco...

690
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:03,551
and on all of them, the same checker,
this guy Thomas Pakusa...

691
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:06,520
he goes by Horseface, he's the one working.

692
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,951
You went at him already, right?

693
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:12,392
We grand juried his ass,
but that motherfucker didn't blink.

694
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:25,097
You wanna hit the head?
Get yourself right, Detective?

695
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,575
No, I'm good.

696
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:35,874
The point is, we have a pattern here.

697
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:39,214
What they're doing eliminates
almost all of the paper trail.

698
00:47:39,322 --> 00:47:42,052
As long as they can get
a truck past the outbound lanes...

699
00:47:42,158 --> 00:47:45,685
and there's a dozen ways to do that,
the only thing they leave behind...

700
00:47:45,795 --> 00:47:47,592
is a little telltale in the computer.

701
00:47:47,697 --> 00:47:51,098
A box comes off the ship,
flashes for a few moments and blip...

702
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,663
then it's gone.

703
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:59,999
Our target
is supposed to be Sobotka, right?

704
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:01,771
I mean, on paper anyway.

705
00:48:02,812 --> 00:48:05,610
What you're telling me is
that it's better than a fair bet...

706
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:08,377
that he actually is
a target in Bunk's murders.

707
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:18,752
Maybe we can fold our investigation
into yours, Lieutenant.

708
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:22,389
And put my ass in the air with
14 open homicides that might never clear?

709
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:26,026
- The bosses wouldn't blame you for that.
- I wouldn't shine either.

710
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:29,469
I'm using what we do with this detail
to get a major case squad going.

711
00:48:29,572 --> 00:48:33,975
I come up out of here with all those
open files, it doesn't smell as sweet.

712
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:37,708
- So what's the next move on this?
- We clone the computer...

713
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:41,614
and start watching
what's happening on the docks in real time.

714
00:48:55,665 --> 00:48:56,723
Shit.

715
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:05,768
Yo, D.

716
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:32,464
Just wine, huh?

717
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:35,598
I'm not drinking much anymore.

718
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:37,537
No Jameson's?

719
00:49:38,808 --> 00:49:41,572
Maybe a quick fuck with the waitress, then.

720
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,071
Okay, I deserve that one, too...

721
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:47,240
even though I'm not doing
much of that anymore either.

722
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:49,750
- Anything else?
- I'm sorry.

723
00:49:50,553 --> 00:49:53,078
I don't know where it still comes from.
It's been a year.

724
00:49:53,189 --> 00:49:56,454
- You deserve to be angry.
- What's the point, though?

725
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:00,860
How's work?

726
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,991
What, so we talk about
everything in my life...

727
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:06,591
that pisses you off?

728
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:10,503
- Drinking, women, the work?
- Just trying to make conversation.

729
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:15,606
- I retired.
- Excuse me?

730
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:20,742
It's boats, not bodies.

731
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:24,911
On a good day,
I catch crabs and count seagulls.

732
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:28,250
- That's not you.
- It wasn't me.

733
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:32,786
It wasn't me not to drink,
or dog around either.

734
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,324
A lot of things weren't me.

735
00:50:41,604 --> 00:50:43,435
I want another chance.

736
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,406
How about a fuck for the road instead?

737
00:51:29,185 --> 00:51:30,652
- How you doing?
- Okay.

738
00:51:30,753 --> 00:51:33,347
You unload this,
you gotta ditch trucks and trailers both.

739
00:51:33,456 --> 00:51:36,425
Make it look like it was a hijack, all right?

740
00:51:37,193 --> 00:51:38,251
Niko.

741
00:51:40,463 --> 00:51:43,626
If you want, I will pay you straight...

742
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:47,830
or Eton can pay in heroin.

743
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:50,836
Wholesale.

744
00:51:54,577 --> 00:51:58,308
Turn it around,
you can make $60,000 or $70,000.

745
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:04,179
Nicky, he's offering, like,
three, four times the value.

746
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,181
I'm out on this.

747
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:12,328
Nick, even if we walk it up to White Mike...

748
00:52:12,428 --> 00:52:14,589
we can make $30,000 or $35,000.

749
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,562
Nicky, come on, man.

750
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,635
Half in cash, half in dope.

751
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:42,085
Nicky, I can turn that package around,
no problem.

752
00:52:42,191 --> 00:52:44,159
- No, Zig, I got it.
- Nicky, you don't know--

753
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,058
You hear me? I said I fucking got this one.

754
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:49,161
Stay at home and watch cartoons.

755
00:52:49,265 --> 00:52:52,235
Let me handle this shit
for the both of us, all right?

756
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,709
You fucking walking home or what?

757
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,219
Hey, girl.

758
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:17,623
- What do we do with the day?
- Me?

759
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:22,458
- I gotta pick up the boys from the sitter.
- Okay, great.

760
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:26,565
They're gonna be coming back here.
Michael has piano this afternoon.

761
00:53:26,669 --> 00:53:28,830
No problem, we'll do something after that.

762
00:53:28,938 --> 00:53:31,736
Maybe we go by my place,
pick up some things.

763
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:37,337
I don't want the boys to know
that you were here.

764
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:39,642
It's gonna get them hoping.

765
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:44,380
So you need to leave.

766
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:02,037
Look at this sorry shit.

767
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:06,037
Motherfuckers not appreciate
nothing that comes to them free.

768
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:11,070
I'll take it in the back.
Maybe they got some duct tape to fix it.

769
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:45,814
- D, right?
- Yeah.

770
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:47,280
You can't be in here now, man.

771
00:54:47,383 --> 00:54:49,817
Yo, man, y'all get any final calls
this week, yo?

772
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:52,820
- Yeah, we got some.
- I didn't see any out there.

773
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,184
All right, give me a minute.

774
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:58,590
Let me finish up right here real quick,
and I'll go and get one for you.

775
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:35,079
- Hey, y'all.
- What's up?

776
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:37,955
I know you got my motherfucking cigs, yo.

777
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,019
- You trying to curb me, yo?
- Come on.

778
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:41,687
What's in there?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
