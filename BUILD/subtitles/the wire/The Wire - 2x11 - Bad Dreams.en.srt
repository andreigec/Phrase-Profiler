1
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:27,613
Wake up, Baltimore. It's 6:00 a.m...

2
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:28,919
Police!

3
00:00:43,407 --> 00:00:44,567
Ready?

4
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,309
Freeze, FBI!

5
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:53,140
- All clear.
- Check upstairs.

6
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:57,079
Turn around.

7
00:00:57,454 --> 00:00:59,979
Put your hands up. Behind your neck.

8
00:01:01,358 --> 00:01:02,950
Keep them there.

9
00:01:20,577 --> 00:01:22,636
No, nothing here. All clear.

10
00:01:55,512 --> 00:01:56,740
All clear.

11
00:02:07,124 --> 00:02:10,059
You won't find a goddamn thing!
I can tell you that right now.

12
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,957
Ain't got shit on me.

13
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:18,526
Fuck! You ain't got nothing.
I'm telling you. Nothing!

14
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:27,066
Move, shitbird.

15
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:41,223
FBI, show me your hands!

16
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:51,166
Get down, fuck! Get down!

17
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:06,574
Nice.

18
00:03:20,631 --> 00:03:21,757
Bingo.

19
00:03:25,602 --> 00:03:29,538
- From behind your clothes washer.
- That's heroin, 300 gelcaps.

20
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,983
And on today's Chip Franklin Show
at noon...

21
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:44,543
Chip will be live at Arundel Mills Mall
asking local retailers:

22
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:46,987
"What do you get
for the guy who has everything?"

23
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:49,059
Now here's Steve Stewart with sports.

24
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,594
The Orioles continue to...

25
00:05:49,313 --> 00:05:52,646
- We could take him now.
- Not enough profile.

26
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:56,485
Fucking feds.

27
00:05:57,054 --> 00:05:59,614
Be advised, target 27 is on the move.

28
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:15,167
I don't get it.
Why leave Vondopoulos out on the street?

29
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:19,133
The text message that told him to clean up,
it came from someone higher up.

30
00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:20,505
Someone we don't know.

31
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:22,704
We leave him on the street
after these raids...

32
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:25,304
he'll probably make contact
with whoever's above him.

33
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:28,043
Either another text message or a meet.

34
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:30,277
What's with George Glekas?

35
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:33,117
I'm afraid he's gonna duck this warrant.

36
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:38,221
- Chester Karol Sobotka?
- It's Frank Sobotka's kid.

37
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:41,625
Frank's kid kills one of our targets?
Are you shitting me?

38
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:43,199
Why? What for?

39
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,258
We hit the store this morning.

40
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:48,338
Every shred of paper's gone.
Just a bloodstain on the floor.

41
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:51,532
So we go over to his house a half hour later
with the warrant...

42
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:56,136
and it's full up with red-eyed Greek relations
looking at us like we're braindeads.

43
00:06:59,383 --> 00:07:00,748
Homicide, Shea.

44
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:03,445
- This is Daniels, out at Southeast.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:06,386
Who caught the Highlandtown murder
the night before last?

46
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,151
Jay Landsman, sir.

47
00:07:10,193 --> 00:07:11,888
I'll be right over.

48
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:21,231
Go get the interviews started.

49
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,483
- Lieutenant?
- Hey, Lt.

50
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:49,323
What the fuck is that about?

51
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,635
How did we do this morning?

52
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:55,772
Eton and Sergei are in. So is the madam.

53
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,702
Glekas, I'm not sure.

54
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:03,409
- The feds are waiting on Sobotka.
- What are they waiting for?

55
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:05,771
You don't wanna know.

56
00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:07,374
Jesus, Larry...

57
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:10,920
The thing is, I think we gotta reach out
to a criminal lawyer real quick.

58
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:13,182
If the union guys can't handle this mess...

59
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,190
he's gonna have a bail hearing tomorrow.

60
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:17,852
- Do you have any details?
- I don't know nothing...

61
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:20,555
except he's locked up for it.
I can't see him till 10:00.

62
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:23,462
- That's the only time?
- Visiting hours, yeah.

63
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,592
Look, everything's gonna be fine.

64
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:39,038
- FBI! All of you move, now!
- What the fuck is this?

65
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:42,010
- FBI, move!
- Against the wall.

66
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:46,248
He's here.

67
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,558
Got another problem here, Larry.

68
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:04,703
Big man on the docks.

69
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:08,676
You don't look so big now, do you?

70
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:52,278
Ma.

71
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:15,568
Pop.

72
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:31,423
It's gone.

73
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:34,491
And the money, too.

74
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,494
They say you need to come in.

75
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:42,430
They said the warrant
is at Southeastern police district.

76
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:50,309
They're out there now.

77
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,675
Showtime, Franky.

78
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:08,231
- Frank.
- Sir, any comment?

79
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:11,058
Is it just you, or is it the whole union?

80
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:14,466
What's your comment
on the charges being brought against you?

81
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:19,140
Sir, do you have anything at all to say?
Any comment at all?

82
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:22,006
How will you answer
the charges against you?

83
00:11:23,747 --> 00:11:27,308
Let me ask you, who exactly am I working
all these dead girls for?

84
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:28,884
The Homicide unit, right?

85
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:32,853
The same Homicide unit that can't put
two and two together and pick up a phone...

86
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:36,619
leaving me to read it a day-and-a-half later
in The Baltimore Sun.

87
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:46,835
- What did you take from the scene?
- Photos, latents, spent casings.

88
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,307
Fuck.

89
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:53,936
They cleaned everything else?

90
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:58,771
Even for a supremely
fucked-up police department...

91
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:00,645
this takes the prize.

92
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:09,822
How'd the kid play it?

93
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,552
He signed a full statement.

94
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:15,062
He said that there was an argument
about a stolen car or two.

95
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:17,099
Think he'll open up and talk more?

96
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,259
He's been processed and assigned a PD.

97
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:23,669
If you want to take a run at the kid,
you're gonna have to get around his lawyer.

98
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,541
I'm sorry, Lieutenant. It's my bad.

99
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,883
State your name, asshole.
What's your name?

100
00:12:38,254 --> 00:12:39,846
What's your name?

101
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,058
State your name.

102
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:57,104
Come on, you know this part.
Give us a name.

103
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:03,306
There is your name.

104
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:07,240
State your name.

105
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:12,382
No name?

106
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:17,117
- For now, we'll just call you Boris.
- Boris.

107
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:20,924
Why always "Boris"?

108
00:13:21,831 --> 00:13:25,733
Racketeering. Wire fraud.
Conspiracy to import heroin.

109
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:28,963
Conspiracy to violate
federal customs statutes.

110
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:30,539
White slavery.

111
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:35,641
Today we're only charging
the customs violations, Mr. Sobotka.

112
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:40,514
But eventually, a grand jury indictment
will expose you to a lot more.

113
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:47,253
Name names, and come clean.
You help yourself and your union.

114
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:49,681
Help my union?

115
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:55,998
For 25 years,
we've been dying slow down there.

116
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,200
Dry docks rusting, piers standing empty.

117
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:04,468
My friends and their kids,
like we got the cancer.

118
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:08,203
No lifeline got thrown all that time.
Nothing from nobody.

119
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:11,771
And now you wanna help us?

120
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:14,076
Help me?

121
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:23,051
- What's your full name?
- Michael McArdle.

122
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,888
- White Mike.
- Yeah, that's right.

123
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:26,256
Listen to this, Mikey.

124
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:27,920
I wanna know it wasn't your people...

125
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:30,226
dropped that body on Potee Street
the other night.

126
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,893
I'm asking 'cause it was someone
with a Greek-ass name...

127
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,766
and fuck if he wasn't dumped
in front of a house I was using.

128
00:14:35,872 --> 00:14:38,306
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

129
00:14:38,408 --> 00:14:40,376
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

130
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:45,142
We hit your suppliers.

131
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:47,478
They cleaned up
and left you holding the dirt.

132
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:50,576
- Suppliers of what?
- You discussed a drug buy on this tape.

133
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:53,451
We also have photographs
tying you to your stash house...

134
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:57,583
and putting you at The Greek's warehouse
over on Newkirk Street for re-ups.

135
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:01,426
Do yourself a solid here, Mike.

136
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:16,610
- What's the plan?
- This is just a detention hearing, Frank.

137
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:19,443
You're not a flight risk,
you have no meaningful priors.

138
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:21,983
And so far they've only hit you
with one count.

139
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:24,952
The magistrate's gonna ask us
some basic questions.

140
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:27,522
Barring anything unforeseen,
you're out in an hour.

141
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:30,286
- I said nothing to them suits.
- All the better.

142
00:15:31,694 --> 00:15:35,186
- This Eton, he's in charge of what exactly?
- The dope.

143
00:15:36,032 --> 00:15:37,624
He's what, Greek?

144
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:41,168
He's a Jew.
You know, from that Jew country they got.

145
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:45,435
- And what about the guy they call Sergei?
- Sergei's straight muscle.

146
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:49,769
- Look, I need something to eat.
- Okay, what do you want?

147
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,871
Two hot dogs and a strawberry soda.

148
00:15:53,883 --> 00:15:55,748
I'd fuck the order up.

149
00:15:57,987 --> 00:15:59,978
It's gotta be strawberry?

150
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:01,890
Hook a brother up.

151
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,533
Big man, that ain't gonna work for Omar.

152
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:15,661
It's all right.

153
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:22,938
Been what, a year?

154
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:27,439
Boy, you don't know,
I been dreaming of running into you again.

155
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,144
You got a focus. I give you that.

156
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,255
Man be like that when he got work to do.
You know what I mean?

157
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:34,914
I think you've done enough.

158
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:37,959
Bird gone.
Wee-Bey copped out to all them murders.

159
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:40,427
He in jail now forever and a day.

160
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:44,758
Stinkum? I mean, you closed the book
on that nigger your damn self.

161
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:48,565
Avon, he out of pocket for the time being.

162
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:50,636
Leaving you.

163
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,267
- You looking for closure?
- Lookit, man, ain't no closure.

164
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,214
Not unless Brandon walk up out his grave
and come up in this room right now.

165
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:03,012
See, all I know is whoever did him that way,
they gets got.

166
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:07,381
Whoever did him that way,
they still out there right now.

167
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,115
So now you gonna play like
you had nothing to do with it.

168
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:11,784
No, I can't lie.

169
00:17:11,895 --> 00:17:16,229
I put the motherfucking paper out on y'all.
But y'all was fucking with my stash.

170
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:19,160
Anything after that, part of the game.

171
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:22,666
Maybe. But see,
I went past that with Brandon.

172
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:26,805
That wasn't me. That wasn't Avon, either.

173
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:31,680
Bird and them were there to see it.
But another man did all the extras:

174
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,941
all that cigarette shit...

175
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:37,677
all that bullshit with the eyes.

176
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:41,154
See now, this man,
he building a rep for himself...

177
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:43,354
and he wants you bad.

178
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:46,753
The brutal shit, that's his calling card.

179
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:51,032
Little bow-tie wearing motherfucker
from out of...

180
00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:52,192
NYC?

181
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:54,561
Yeah, small dude.

182
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,807
What he go by?

183
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,868
Brother Mouzone.

184
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,544
I know you heard of him, right?

185
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:10,147
So if y'all got the mind to go after him...

186
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:13,313
I might be able to point you
in that direction.

187
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:14,880
Why?

188
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:18,285
What happened to your boy was business.

189
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:22,529
But how that shit happened,
you got the right to take that to heart.

190
00:18:22,632 --> 00:18:24,827
I figure that'll make us even.

191
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:28,131
Now, you wanna know where this nigger is?

192
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:34,102
- We need to sit down and talk, Frank.
- I gotta see my son.

193
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,974
The man's right.
Let's grab a cup of coffee or something.

194
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,241
Not now, I need to get clean.

195
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:43,645
Sergei and them...

196
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:47,617
they did Mau Mau Willis.

197
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:50,693
- Why'd they chill him?
- He was welshing on the Jew.

198
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:55,093
Okay, Sergei's a soldier.
But he and Eton report to somebody.

199
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:58,632
- Who's above those two, Mike?
- I don't know.

200
00:19:00,703 --> 00:19:03,297
- You don't know?
- Never did wanna know.

201
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:17,715
God in heaven, Zig,
the cops do that to you?

202
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:20,755
Ain't the cops.

203
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:34,534
Lawyers are saying the bail might be tough.

204
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:37,437
I'm trying.

205
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:40,934
You know I'm trying, right?

206
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:46,209
- What happened?
- I don't know.

207
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:49,549
I got tired.

208
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:56,117
I got tired of being the punchline
to every joke.

209
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:04,092
You had problems,
you could've come to me.

210
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,327
You could've said something.

211
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:09,537
You wouldn't have heard.

212
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,866
You were always too busy
dredging up the canal.

213
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:17,872
Making sure the right bum got elected.

214
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:21,316
Buying another round for the house.

215
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:31,655
I always used to think you were working
all them hours you spent away.

216
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:35,619
It was all work, Zig, even when it wasn't.

217
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:38,962
For you, for your mother.

218
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:43,362
I bet you didn't even tell her
I was in here, did you?

219
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:45,440
Maybe you did...

220
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:49,711
and she already took three Nembutals,
sleeping the day away.

221
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:54,275
- Leave her out of this.
- She's out of it, don't worry.

222
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:00,355
Pop...

223
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:07,019
when I seen what I did
to that kid down at the store...

224
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,325
it made me sick to my stomach.

225
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:14,192
- That ain't you, Zig.
- It ain't?

226
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:19,370
Because the same blood
don't flow for us, Pop.

227
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:22,000
I mean, I wish it did, but it don't.

228
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:25,746
You're more like me than you know.

229
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:31,344
You're a Sobotka.

230
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:38,950
Fucked is what I am.

231
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:55,473
What the fuck can I say?

232
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:23,904
Best progress so far
is "White Mike" McArdle.

233
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,701
He's standing on the edge of the cliff.

234
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:29,869
We're gonna get Pearlman in today
to see what she can do to step him off.

235
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:32,880
Also, we're still hunting
the Sobotka nephew.

236
00:22:33,082 --> 00:22:34,640
Herc and Carver are on that.

237
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,617
Still, my guess is the drug players...

238
00:22:38,888 --> 00:22:41,755
even if they roll, give us Eton and Sergei.

239
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,493
The case gets thin when we get up to this...

240
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,891
Spiros Vondopoulos.

241
00:22:48,998 --> 00:22:51,364
Boy, them Greeks
and those twisted-ass names.

242
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:53,833
Lay off the Greeks.
They invented civilization.

243
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:55,767
Yeah? Ass-fucking, too.

244
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:58,606
What exactly do we know
about Vondopoulos?

245
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:01,609
We should stay on him, see who he really is.

246
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:03,277
How about it?

247
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:06,707
Throw us a few
of your well-equipped surveillance teams?

248
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:10,744
In case you haven't noticed, Lieutenant,
I'm the only fed still in the room.

249
00:23:10,853 --> 00:23:13,651
The US attorney has what he wants
with the union guys...

250
00:23:13,756 --> 00:23:17,317
which means my field office
is pretty much over this case.

251
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:20,391
Okay, we're on Vondopoulos ourselves.

252
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:26,463
I'm sorry for him...

253
00:23:27,603 --> 00:23:29,002
and for you.

254
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,707
We should've paid more attention
to our own.

255
00:23:34,043 --> 00:23:37,206
Like I could've stopped Ziggy
from what he'd done.

256
00:23:37,847 --> 00:23:39,940
Like anyone could ever control him.

257
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:42,279
I was thinking of my boy, too.

258
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,947
They're dropping the net on all the guys.

259
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:49,923
Ain't no secret
things get lost in them cans now and again.

260
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:51,721
He'll be all right.

261
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:54,522
They tossed my house, Frank.

262
00:23:55,231 --> 00:23:58,826
They don't do that when there's
a couple of cases of vodka missing.

263
00:24:01,037 --> 00:24:05,804
They made me sign the search warrant.
That's a receipt-like for what they found.

264
00:24:06,976 --> 00:24:10,002
Heroin, Frank. From this house.

265
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:13,673
No, that ain't right. That can't be right.

266
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:19,511
I knew Nicky and Zig was boosting stuff.
Cameras, shit like that. Nothing like this.

267
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:20,850
You knew?

268
00:24:22,658 --> 00:24:26,116
And once Nicky got used to boosting stuff
and seeing a little money...

269
00:24:26,228 --> 00:24:30,562
what did you think he was gonna do?
Turn straight all of a sudden and give it up?

270
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,358
No, Frank.

271
00:24:33,035 --> 00:24:36,266
Once you gave him
a taste on the house, just...

272
00:24:36,706 --> 00:24:40,574
That was never... I mean, he knew. He knew.

273
00:24:41,143 --> 00:24:43,304
Everything I did, the cans I let through...

274
00:24:43,412 --> 00:24:46,040
the money we got from that
went to keeping what we had.

275
00:24:46,148 --> 00:24:47,877
God damn it, Frank!

276
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:53,144
Don't let that excuse this. Not this.

277
00:24:56,892 --> 00:24:59,417
Uncle Frank, with the big shoulders.

278
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:02,764
"If it's broke, give it to my uncle.

279
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,325
"He can fix it."

280
00:25:30,426 --> 00:25:33,486
Hey, Killer.
I got something for you, come here.

281
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:51,439
You got the new Harper's yet?

282
00:25:53,182 --> 00:25:55,013
Now, you know stores down the way...

283
00:25:55,117 --> 00:25:58,052
don't have nothing past Vibe
and Handguns Today.

284
00:25:58,421 --> 00:26:00,821
Some titty mags, too, if you need.

285
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,149
All right. I got you.

286
00:26:03,526 --> 00:26:06,290
I'm gonna hook you up, though, all right?

287
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:13,967
Hey, boy. Told you I had something for you.

288
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,603
There you go.

289
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:18,134
That's my good boy.

290
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:10,787
Good day for a ship.

291
00:27:11,427 --> 00:27:14,988
This is the hiring hall, Frank.
Working stevedores only.

292
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:21,432
Big Roy, let me have your card.

293
00:27:23,405 --> 00:27:24,963
What do you want my card for?

294
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:27,736
Not you. Little Big Roy,
let me hold your card.

295
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:30,944
I need it.
I'm gonna work the Cape St. George today.

296
00:27:31,046 --> 00:27:33,640
- I'll work it for you.
- Work it for me?

297
00:27:33,883 --> 00:27:37,478
I work the ship on your card.
You work a barstool down Clement Street.

298
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:39,781
End of the week, you get paid.

299
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,167
Hey, Phil.

300
00:27:58,207 --> 00:28:00,732
I'm putting up for the Cape St. George.

301
00:28:00,843 --> 00:28:02,902
I don't see no resemblance.

302
00:28:03,112 --> 00:28:07,412
We're both bald, we're both Polacks.
What the fuck else you need to know?

303
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:30,137
Who's gonna work for me?

304
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:35,377
- A different look for our boy.
- Perry Ellis or something.

305
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:39,774
How would a just-rolled-out-of-bed-looking
motherfucker like you...

306
00:28:39,882 --> 00:28:41,509
know the designer?

307
00:28:43,552 --> 00:28:45,247
Okay, I'm guessing.

308
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:48,952
It's a Joseph Abboud.

309
00:28:49,725 --> 00:28:52,660
He puts dark buttons instead of brass
on his blazers.

310
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:54,626
That's the Abboud signature.

311
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,565
You know what they call a guy who pays
that much attention to his clothes, right?

312
00:28:59,768 --> 00:29:01,099
A grown-up.

313
00:29:03,072 --> 00:29:04,334
We're up.

314
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:08,499
- 12-14, let's go.
- Copy, 11-34.

315
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:26,923
- That's a first.
- Sweat from a checker.

316
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:03,228
- You all right?
- Ready.

317
00:30:05,334 --> 00:30:07,894
Maybe you ought to set up an easel
on the sidewalk...

318
00:30:08,003 --> 00:30:10,767
- and do a sketch instead.
- I'm fine.

319
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:40,395
- Anything I ought to know?
- Yeah. Use the city.

320
00:30:41,236 --> 00:30:44,433
Windows, mirrors, reflections,
anything like that.

321
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:49,702
Stay on my frequency, hear?

322
00:30:53,716 --> 00:30:56,446
Vondopoulos should be coming out
of the garage on foot...

323
00:30:56,552 --> 00:30:58,679
- right about now.
- Copy that.

324
00:32:01,116 --> 00:32:04,677
Beadie Russell. She wasn't much
when we started, you know.

325
00:32:04,787 --> 00:32:06,652
But now she's got game.

326
00:32:29,545 --> 00:32:30,842
Thank you.

327
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:28,027
12-14. I got him going into
a fifth floor room.

328
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,465
Note the number
then get down to the lobby.

329
00:33:30,572 --> 00:33:33,200
- Wait on him there.
- Copy.

330
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,821
She's got Vondopoulos in a room.
It could be a while.

331
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:53,519
Copy.

332
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:07,765
- All this shit's going out to chassis?
- That's what they tell me.

333
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:10,777
We need a forklift. We're almost done here.

334
00:34:26,762 --> 00:34:30,254
12-14. Vondopoulos and another man,
middle-aged, blue suit...

335
00:34:30,365 --> 00:34:33,801
leaving the front door of the hotel.
They're just behind me. Copy?

336
00:34:33,902 --> 00:34:34,994
Copy.

337
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:37,765
11-34.

338
00:34:37,873 --> 00:34:41,866
Subject and companion, blue suit,
leaving the hotel any moment now.

339
00:34:41,977 --> 00:34:43,945
Copy, we got the eyeball.

340
00:34:51,553 --> 00:34:54,249
The man with Vondopoulos
has got to be big.

341
00:34:54,923 --> 00:34:58,825
- I mean, look at that expensive suit.
- Yeah, with them buttons and all.

342
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:18,976
We leave the Benz here?

343
00:35:20,749 --> 00:35:21,977
It's hot.

344
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:41,459
They didn't come back to the Benz.
You got them down there?

345
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,764
Negative.

346
00:36:35,457 --> 00:36:38,688
- You about done?
- These nine here still got to be stripped.

347
00:36:38,794 --> 00:36:41,126
- Harder than it looks.
- What ain't?

348
00:36:43,565 --> 00:36:47,365
- You hear how Moonshot got his name?
- Yeah, and I could give a fuck.

349
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:51,839
Who was the room registered to?

350
00:36:52,307 --> 00:36:56,175
Stephen Rados.
He gave a Northwest D.C. address.

351
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:59,644
Maybe that's the man with the good tailor.
Maybe not.

352
00:36:59,748 --> 00:37:03,377
We should run out the paper trail
on this guy, see what we turn up.

353
00:37:04,152 --> 00:37:07,610
As to our only tangible piece of progress
from the raids...

354
00:37:07,722 --> 00:37:10,486
what can we do for our friend White Mike?

355
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:14,420
He rolls on his suppliers,
and he can walk with a long probation.

356
00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:18,056
- And we can move him, if he needs.
- Witness protection?

357
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:22,794
Why have the feds with you if they're
not gonna step up every now and then?

358
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:26,774
Wait a second. You're gonna give
a drug dealer a ride like that?

359
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,365
What about Frank Sobotka?

360
00:37:28,477 --> 00:37:30,877
The feds took a shot at him and got nothing.

361
00:37:30,979 --> 00:37:32,344
Or so they tell me.

362
00:37:32,447 --> 00:37:35,416
The way I read it, they cared more
about busting up the union--

363
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:39,248
Than anything else in the case.
If we came at Frank straight?

364
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:43,419
You can't make him
any kind of specific offer yourself.

365
00:37:43,525 --> 00:37:47,086
Only I can do that, and only after
I get an okay from my front office.

366
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:50,790
- She could plant the seed.
- There's no better messenger, Counselor.

367
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:54,766
Take a shot.

368
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:59,231
- You going to his house?
- The Union Hall. That's his house.

369
00:38:01,176 --> 00:38:03,269
Thanks for waiting, Brucie. Sorry I'm late.

370
00:38:03,378 --> 00:38:05,471
I shouldn't even be seen with you
at this point.

371
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,844
I just wanna settle our business
while we still can.

372
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:11,077
It ain't like I'm gonna get my hands
on more cash, obviously.

373
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:13,086
The grain pier is dead.

374
00:38:14,723 --> 00:38:18,124
Half the votes we had lined up
are walking sideways now.

375
00:38:18,226 --> 00:38:19,784
They read the paper, Frank.

376
00:38:19,895 --> 00:38:23,831
So what? So I'm dirty.
The grain pier's still the grain pier, right?

377
00:38:23,932 --> 00:38:26,457
They ain't voting for me, Brucie!
It ain't about me!

378
00:38:26,568 --> 00:38:27,694
I'm not gonna lie.

379
00:38:27,802 --> 00:38:31,329
No one is gonna stand with us
now that the FBI is on you.

380
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:33,634
- They're scared.
- Of what?

381
00:38:34,009 --> 00:38:35,738
They took the money, Frank.

382
00:38:35,844 --> 00:38:39,803
And now if they deliver the votes,
they figure the feds will be on them, too.

383
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:41,507
I'm sorry, Frank.

384
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:44,677
You find a way
of putting this FBI thing to bed...

385
00:38:44,786 --> 00:38:47,482
maybe we can come back the next session
with the grain pier.

386
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:51,719
You'll have a couple of people down there
knowing they owe you a vote or two.

387
00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:56,892
I don't know what else to say. I don't.
I'm sorry, Frank.

388
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:02,793
You know what the trouble is, Brucie?

389
00:39:06,274 --> 00:39:09,368
We used to make shit in this country.
Build shit.

390
00:39:11,513 --> 00:39:14,710
Now we just put our hand
in the next guy's pocket.

391
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:39,802
Come on, you can't eat only olives.
Order something. Lamb or something.

392
00:39:40,275 --> 00:39:41,799
I'm not hungry.

393
00:39:46,348 --> 00:39:47,679
All this trouble.

394
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,347
- So, our associates, they are strong?
- Yes.

395
00:39:55,624 --> 00:39:59,219
I don't worry about our people.
We can try to get them out before the trial.

396
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:01,454
If not, they will stand for us.

397
00:40:02,564 --> 00:40:06,432
We have shown them too much.
There will be no more trouble.

398
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:09,530
We must make certain of this.

399
00:40:10,272 --> 00:40:13,799
- Maybe there's another way.
- There is only one sure way.

400
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:15,168
Hear me out.

401
00:40:15,277 --> 00:40:18,838
If I could guarantee
that Frank Sobotka and his nephew...

402
00:40:18,947 --> 00:40:20,608
would be silent...

403
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:23,517
wouldn't you prefer that?

404
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:26,016
But you cannot guarantee this.

405
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:29,557
Frank's son,
the idiot who shot George in his store...

406
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:33,085
he is going to jail for a long time...

407
00:40:33,862 --> 00:40:35,159
unless...

408
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:41,569
There was a young clerk wounded that day
in the store.

409
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:45,271
The prosecutors want to use him
as a witness.

410
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:47,034
I know his family.

411
00:40:48,276 --> 00:40:50,836
Frank Sobotka will have his son back.

412
00:40:51,513 --> 00:40:55,040
If a man can have this,
why would he talk to the police?

413
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,315
What about Frank's nephew?

414
00:40:57,419 --> 00:41:00,752
He is the idiot's cousin.
He wants the same thing as Frank.

415
00:41:00,855 --> 00:41:03,949
Anyway, I don't worry about Niko.

416
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:09,488
You are fond of him, Spiros.

417
00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:12,399
You should've had a son.

418
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:15,366
But then I would've had a wife.

419
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:30,174
If this maggot doesn't post by midnight,
I'm gonna take it personal.

420
00:41:34,055 --> 00:41:36,751
The shitbird lives in his parents' basement.

421
00:41:39,961 --> 00:41:42,361
Where's a guy like that gonna run?

422
00:42:22,404 --> 00:42:25,066
You wanna go with Auntie Tasha? Come on.

423
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:29,066
Nice and easy, honey.

424
00:42:29,177 --> 00:42:31,805
- Come here.
- All right, come on, baby.

425
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,978
What's up, big man? Where the party at?

426
00:42:35,216 --> 00:42:37,184
Ain't no party up in here, girl.

427
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:41,278
We thought Darnell and everybody
was gonna get their smoke on.

428
00:42:41,556 --> 00:42:43,421
Don't you know Darnell?

429
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:45,951
What's this good boy's name?

430
00:42:46,327 --> 00:42:47,521
Hey, boy.

431
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:49,921
How you doing today?

432
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:52,295
You been good? This a good boy.

433
00:42:53,168 --> 00:42:56,365
- There it is.
- Car will be running.

434
00:43:01,476 --> 00:43:03,068
What is it, Lamar?

435
00:43:11,386 --> 00:43:13,354
No need to prolong this.

436
00:43:14,222 --> 00:43:15,780
No, we got time.

437
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:18,888
- You kill my man?
- No, he's resting.

438
00:43:22,764 --> 00:43:26,996
- I'm saying, ain't you wanna know?
- Not particularly.

439
00:43:28,102 --> 00:43:31,265
About a year ago, a boy name Brandon got
got here in Baltimore.

440
00:43:31,372 --> 00:43:33,772
Stuck and burned before he passed.

441
00:43:34,442 --> 00:43:37,411
- The game is the game.
- Indeed.

442
00:43:38,446 --> 00:43:40,277
See, that boy was beautiful.

443
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,940
Wasn't no need for y'all to do him
the way y'all did.

444
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:44,416
You feel me?

445
00:43:44,686 --> 00:43:47,086
- A year, you say?
- About that.

446
00:43:50,191 --> 00:43:52,625
You've got some wrong information.

447
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:55,061
Man, you lying to live.

448
00:43:55,897 --> 00:43:57,865
I'm at peace with my God.

449
00:43:59,067 --> 00:44:00,659
Do what you will.

450
00:44:18,786 --> 00:44:20,151
So you know?

451
00:44:21,189 --> 00:44:24,454
What happened to your boy,
it's not my style.

452
00:44:30,698 --> 00:44:35,032
The way you bleeding out your back,
looks like that bullet bore clean through.

453
00:44:36,671 --> 00:44:39,071
9mm at close range will do that.

454
00:44:49,317 --> 00:44:51,547
Emergency. Do you need police
or ambulance?

455
00:44:51,653 --> 00:44:54,486
I wanna report a shooting
over here at the new motel.

456
00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:57,854
- On North Avenue. Room 221.
- Sir?

457
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:33,351
My pal, Beatrice.

458
00:45:34,696 --> 00:45:38,462
What, you gonna run me in again?
Isn't that like double jeopardy or some shit?

459
00:45:38,566 --> 00:45:40,397
Stop it, just stop it.

460
00:45:43,538 --> 00:45:45,802
- Talk to me.
- And say what?

461
00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:53,772
I'm sitting here trying to figure it out myself.

462
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:55,940
It didn't happen overnight.

463
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,989
I knew I was wrong.

464
00:46:09,797 --> 00:46:13,130
But in my head, I thought I was wrong
for the right reasons, you know?

465
00:46:13,234 --> 00:46:15,725
There are different kinds of wrong.

466
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,433
What're you doing here, Bea?

467
00:46:23,311 --> 00:46:26,712
I'd like you to come in. Not in cuffs.

468
00:46:28,149 --> 00:46:30,117
Because you want to.

469
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:33,883
I'm opening a door here, Frank.

470
00:46:43,297 --> 00:46:45,458
I can't promise you anything.

471
00:46:47,168 --> 00:46:49,762
Just come in. We'll start from there.

472
00:46:55,543 --> 00:46:58,444
You're better than them you got in bed with.

473
00:47:08,456 --> 00:47:12,153
- Our man Vondopoulos didn't come home?
- Maybe he got lucky.

474
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:17,055
Maybe we didn't.

475
00:47:18,766 --> 00:47:22,497
You think he ditched the Benz
because he picked up the tail?

476
00:47:30,878 --> 00:47:33,039
Nicky from the docks.

477
00:47:36,784 --> 00:47:39,582
If you hadn't called last night,
I'd have never found you.

478
00:47:39,687 --> 00:47:41,416
Relax, Niko, come on.

479
00:47:42,724 --> 00:47:45,158
It's like I told you on the phone.

480
00:47:45,326 --> 00:47:48,420
It is going to be all right.
We can make it all right.

481
00:47:48,529 --> 00:47:51,157
I should have never gone down the road
with you people.

482
00:47:51,265 --> 00:47:55,133
Come on.
You tried to make something of yourself.

483
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:57,303
There's no harm in that.

484
00:47:57,772 --> 00:47:59,831
And you still have friends.

485
00:48:00,174 --> 00:48:01,505
I'm busted.

486
00:48:02,877 --> 00:48:06,836
So is my uncle and the whole fucking union.
And Ziggy?

487
00:48:08,449 --> 00:48:10,747
- Christ!
- We will be a friend to him, too.

488
00:48:10,852 --> 00:48:14,219
Nothing your people can do about that.
Ziggy's done.

489
00:48:15,823 --> 00:48:19,315
Nothing is done, Niko. Nothing.

490
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:22,357
Take a look.

491
00:48:27,468 --> 00:48:29,231
That's not your name.

492
00:48:30,104 --> 00:48:32,197
Many names, many passports.

493
00:48:34,642 --> 00:48:36,473
We can do many things.

494
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,475
What can you do for Ziggy?

495
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:50,318
We ask only loyalty.

496
00:49:04,338 --> 00:49:08,035
Why do they need sticks?
Can't they kick it with their feet?

497
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:13,077
She asked me straight-up to come in,
so I'm here.

498
00:49:13,514 --> 00:49:16,483
First, we need to know
what you're looking for.

499
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:19,348
We don't want any misunderstandings
later on.

500
00:49:19,453 --> 00:49:23,822
I'm just looking for, you know,
some help with my son.

501
00:49:24,725 --> 00:49:28,593
- He can't jail where they got him.
- We move him to a county facility.

502
00:49:30,231 --> 00:49:33,723
- What about my nephew?
- He gets arrested and charged.

503
00:49:33,835 --> 00:49:36,326
But for his cooperation and yours...

504
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:39,796
we can live with straight probation.

505
00:49:41,843 --> 00:49:44,676
But what we can and cannot do
for you and your family...

506
00:49:44,779 --> 00:49:48,806
- depends on the level of your cooperation.
- You mean, how much I give you?

507
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:51,946
I got dirt on all of them.

508
00:49:52,787 --> 00:49:56,450
I'll put myself in, too. Whatever you need.
Anything but the union.

509
00:49:56,557 --> 00:50:00,391
I ain't putting in no union men.
I'll give you them dead girls in the can.

510
00:50:00,494 --> 00:50:02,724
I'll give you The Greek,
all them sons of bitches...

511
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:06,197
just to have it off my chest.
Just look to my son and my nephew.

512
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,734
Mr. Sobotka, at this point
I have to advise you...

513
00:50:08,836 --> 00:50:11,236
you need to retain
the services of an attorney.

514
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:12,601
We're not gonna do this now?

515
00:50:12,707 --> 00:50:14,698
You need to have a lawyer
present in the room.

516
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:18,540
You have that, we can make this happen
first thing tomorrow.

517
00:50:27,388 --> 00:50:29,879
Mr. Sobotka, I gotta ask.

518
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:32,849
Why did you stop using your cellphone?

519
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,657
You guys flagged it.
You think I didn't know?

520
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,042
Under the bridge?

521
00:52:05,086 --> 00:52:08,817
It's out in the open.
I guess the cops can't bug it or nothing.

522
00:52:08,923 --> 00:52:11,391
These guys,
they got a big operation to protect.

523
00:52:11,492 --> 00:52:13,084
They're global-like.

524
00:52:13,194 --> 00:52:16,425
- They're really something?
- You got no idea.

525
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:19,761
I think I got a pretty clear picture
of what they're about.

526
00:52:20,868 --> 00:52:25,100
We ain't talking about a bunch of thieves
rolling drums of olive oil off the docks.

527
00:52:25,206 --> 00:52:26,366
Heroin?

528
00:52:26,774 --> 00:52:29,800
How the fuck did that happen, Nick?
Look at me!

529
00:52:31,078 --> 00:52:33,342
You ain't much more than a kid.

530
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:39,351
Me, I should've known better.
I put you up with them, for what?

531
00:52:41,722 --> 00:52:44,316
I flushed my fucking family, for what?

532
00:52:47,261 --> 00:52:49,821
You know what that is, Nicky? Do you?

533
00:52:52,566 --> 00:52:54,056
A condominium.

534
00:53:00,207 --> 00:53:01,868
I ain't going down there.

535
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:05,467
What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna go in and talk with the police.

536
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:08,980
That's right. I'm gonna do
to those cocksuckers what they did to me.

537
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:11,176
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

538
00:53:12,853 --> 00:53:15,219
They wanna meet with us on Ziggy.

539
00:53:16,957 --> 00:53:18,618
They can lean on that witness...

540
00:53:18,726 --> 00:53:21,854
that kid that he shot,
the one that was there in the store.

541
00:53:21,962 --> 00:53:24,328
The kid's gonna say that
Double G had the gun.

542
00:53:24,432 --> 00:53:27,299
That it was like self-defense or some shit.

543
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,365
Ziggy could walk, Uncle Frank.

544
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:33,467
He could.

545
00:53:36,877 --> 00:53:39,478
- And for that they want what?
- Loyalty.

546
00:53:40,014 --> 00:53:41,481
Motherfuckers!

547
00:54:13,314 --> 00:54:15,009
I'll hear them out.

548
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:19,414
- All right, I'll drive.
- No, it's just me.

549
00:54:20,888 --> 00:54:23,015
You ain't dealing with those guys no more.

550
00:54:23,124 --> 00:54:27,322
- Uncle Frank, me and Spiros--
- I don't fucking want you with me, Nick!

551
00:54:28,596 --> 00:54:29,790
Go home!

552
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:44,729
Your way...

553
00:56:45,966 --> 00:56:47,433
it won't work.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
