1
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:23,867
<i>I got Redis, son. </i>

2
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:25,713
<i>Two for one,
two for one. </i>

3
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:27,544
Got that Rasheed and Beno.

4
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:29,319
Rasheed and Beno.

5
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:30,918
Put some ice on his nuts.

6
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:34,094
Tried and true, that shit
always bring a nigger back.

7
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:36,425
Where we gonna
get ice from down here?

8
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:38,745
Walk him up to bon secours.

9
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:40,842
Rasheed and Beno, Rasheed and Ben.

10
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,366
Can we have an eight-ball?

11
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,560
An eight-ball?

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,220
So, how you doin' today?

13
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,070
No offense, but could we
just get the eight-ball?

14
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,229
A- ight, a-ight, just bein' social.

15
00:01:57,391 --> 00:01:58,893
<i>Got it right here, yo. </i>

16
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:02,444
Thank you.

17
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:05,918
Yo, y'all hear about Mack Man jewelers
got took off las' night?

18
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:10,228
All this shit in that rowhouse.
Down yonder.

19
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:13,271
Like a must-move situation.
15 on the dollar.

20
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:17,405
Y'all want some slammin' ice,
go inside and tell my man Rafik sent you.

21
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:21,489
Lighters, pipes, matches.
Pipes, lighters.

22
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:23,648
You need 'em, I got 'em right here.

23
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:24,215
Pipes.

24
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:25,702
<i>Redis. </i>

25
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,831
<i>Two for one, two for one. </i>

26
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,913
As' me if it's loaded, bitch.

27
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,162
<i>Redi-sons, two for one. </i>

28
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:42,638
Anything up?

29
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,312
Just a good package.

30
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:45,625
Three O.D.'s

31
00:02:45,797 --> 00:02:48,723
last one didn't look too good
before by the ambo came, neither.

32
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,658
There's more inside, Carv.

33
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:07,920
Gah-damn!

34
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,846
Can't yoever get a fucking poh-lice
'round here when you need one?!

35
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:47,898
Moral Midgetry

36
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:53,688
Okay, on that burner?

37
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,332
I called Trac,
gave 'em the serial number.

38
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:59,101
Trac Corporation tells me
that they sent it to Northland

39
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,603
a purchasing corporation.

40
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,190
Northland tells me they sent it
to their distribution center in Hagerstown.

41
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,617
Hagerstown tells me they sent it
to buddy's Mondo Mart

42
00:05:07,945 --> 00:05:12,205
at one-four-four-o Propane Road,
Falls Church, Virginia

43
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:14,568
that's where it went out
into the street.

44
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:15,585
What?

45
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:19,446
Did buddy have them on display to the left
or the right of the cash register?

46
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,497
How would I know that?

47
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:27,832
Alright.

48
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:30,530
As for the numbers
in the phone's speed dial

49
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:32,908
we got one local number

50
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:35,567
one number that tracks
to Bodie's grandmother's house

51
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:36,679
on West Baltimore Street

52
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:39,374
and six others numbers
that are all assigned

53
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,549
to Trac disposable cell phones.

54
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:44,021
And those phones were
all purchased outside the city.

55
00:05:44,663 --> 00:05:48,861
One each in Catonsville,
Laurel, Bethesda

56
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:54,446
and stores in Virginia,
at Springfield, Dumfries and Lakeside.

57
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:59,585
Everything is along I-95, from
here to almost Richmond.

58
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:03,339
They're driving 200 miles
every couple of weeks

59
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,780
out of sheer caution.

60
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,164
It's beautiful.

61
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:09,372
What is?

62
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:13,016
The discipline of it.

63
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,960
In your life, did you think you
would ever again see

64
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,385
Mount and Fayette like this?

65
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:23,210
Those ain't touts,
ya hearing, brother.

66
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,779
Those are birds chirpin'.

67
00:06:25,326 --> 00:06:25,702
How?

68
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:28,753
I'll show you.

69
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:31,897
You say no whistles,
no muscle, no flexin'.

70
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:33,884
You supposed to be
all over that shit, man.

71
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:36,566
You even said it's supposed
to be like the valley of eden.

72
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,302
To serve, and protect,
motherfuckers.

73
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,946
- Call it poetic injustice.
- I want to file a report.

74
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:42,620
- Say what?
- You heard me.

75
00:06:42,886 --> 00:06:44,592
You want to make
a complaint to us

76
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,256
that you were selling drugs
and someone took your money?

77
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:47,975
Fuck yes.

78
00:06:55,913 --> 00:06:56,789
Fredericksburg?

79
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,469
They're going all
that way to buy cell phones?

80
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:02,167
One here, two there.
No wholesale purchases.

81
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:04,677
They're dumping phones
every two weeks or so

82
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,234
and still they're worried
about catching a wiretap.

83
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:11,277
Just 'cause you're paranoid doesn't
mean someone's not out to get you.

84
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:11,747
Right?

85
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:15,418
Be nice to know who's buying
all those cell phones, though.

86
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:20,743
Oh, God.

87
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:46,124
Yo, yo, yo, yo. You up, ol' man?

88
00:07:46,672 --> 00:07:48,326
They do have a point though, right?

89
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:51,364
I mean, we tell 'em to comedown
here without the guns

90
00:07:51,376 --> 00:07:53,358
and then we fall down
on providing protection.

91
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:55,891
It's like the stickup crews
have these hoppers feelin'

92
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,147
like they live in a lamb pen.

93
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,174
They see one more gun?

94
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:01,696
Gandhi-world falls apart,
this I guarantee.

95
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:03,843
So what are you doing about it?

96
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:06,588
I sent a few of the vics
over to the district with Herc.

97
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:09,294
Let 'em play with an ident-a-kit,
but you know how that goes.

98
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:10,831
But can I be honest?

99
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,658
It's not just the wolves
circling the corral.

100
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,567
We got 50, 60 kids on the inside

101
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,933
been fight or flight since they
popped out of the chute

102
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,232
and right now they're just
thumb-up-their-ass hangin'.

103
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:22,886
All these ex-runners, ex-lookouts.

104
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,441
That shit worries me as much
as any carnivores out there.

105
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:29,988
If you want to neutralize a threat?

106
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:32,169
Give it a job.

107
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:33,976
As?

108
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:35,653
Auxiliary cops.

109
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,046
Keep an eye out for the predators.

110
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,341
You got the dealers payin' 'em
to do nothing now anyway?

111
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:43,429
Kill two birds and all that.

112
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:44,097
Right.

113
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:47,053
Throw 'em some bikes,
maybe police radios.

114
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:48,531
We could do that.

115
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:49,796
I was being...

116
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:51,438
you're serious?

117
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:53,667
What in God's name did you do here?

118
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:57,643
<i>W.M.D. Got them W.M.D.'s</i>

119
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:03,356
Hey, how you doing?

120
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:05,644
We're looking for a guy
who came in here

121
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:08,459
10, 11 days ago, dropped cash on
a couple of disposable phones?

122
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:10,136
10, 11 days ago?

123
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:11,924
Yeah. Black, most likely.

124
00:09:13,014 --> 00:09:14,352
That really narrows it down.

125
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:17,202
How about we just check
on some of your security tapes?

126
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:18,481
From 10 days ago?

127
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:22,336
Unless there's an incident.
We re-use those video tapes every week.

128
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:23,814
Every week?

129
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:25,433
It's Mondo Mart policy.

130
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:27,721
That went well.

131
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:29,860
Yeah?

132
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,643
<i>Brianna Barksdale called for you. </i>

133
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,218
Who?

134
00:09:32,828 --> 00:09:34,224
<i>D'angelo Barksdale's mother. </i>

135
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:35,831
You get her number?

136
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,379
<i>You got a pen?</i>

137
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:43,440
<i>Four-one-oh, seven-one-eight,
nine-four-apple-three. Got it?</i>

138
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:44,566
Alright.

139
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:45,798
<i>You gonna call her?</i>

140
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:46,384
I dunno...

141
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:48,202
- <i>It's all yours. </i>
- Thanks, Jay.

142
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:50,112
Hey, check it out.

143
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:53,080
Mondo Mart, Mondo Mart,
Mondo Mart, Mondo Mart.

144
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,350
We're fucked. Until we get here...

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,060
Baba Jani Food Mart,
Dumfries, Virginia.

146
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,520
We're gonna go 100 miles

147
00:10:00,537 --> 00:10:03,024
on the off-chance this guy
has a memory or a camera?

148
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:06,836
Do you really wanna go home early
and disappoint Lester Freamon?

149
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:09,722
Who was that who rang?

150
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,964
Guess who's calling homicide
looking for me on D'Angelo Barksdale?

151
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:14,465
His mama.

152
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:15,111
Yeah?

153
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:17,691
Shit, I forgot I'd even tried
to press that thing

154
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:19,744
and now she's
calling up asking questions.

155
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:21,244
Waste of her time as it was mine.

156
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:25,478
Kinda like this road trip.

157
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:33,712
He do look natural.

158
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:39,190
This motherfucker Marlo?

159
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:42,781
We gonna have to get
deep on this nigger.

160
00:10:46,735 --> 00:10:49,022
I mean it feels like
ain't shit change

161
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,556
except for a growing
lightness in my wallet.

162
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:54,825
Where's my letter of approval, man,
from the preservation motherfuckers?

163
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:56,713
My right-of-way agreement?
My sign-offs.

164
00:10:56,737 --> 00:10:59,634
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
everything's right around the corner.

165
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,610
We got both the plumbing and
the electrical inspectors on for tomorrow

166
00:11:03,772 --> 00:11:06,939
tuesday the fire department's coming out,
and that should do it, String

167
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:08,206
you'll be on your way.

168
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:12,733
And by the way, congratulations.

169
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:17,727
You are now minority contractor
for light bulb supply

170
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:19,944
to the Board of Education,
city of Baltimore.

171
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:23,944
What the fuck I know
about light bulbs, man?

172
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:26,642
Do you know how to put the words
on a B-and-B letterhead?

173
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:30,994
Come on, man, relax,
white guy's doing all the work.

174
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:33,627
You're just his beard
for the empowerment grant.

175
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:37,240
That's an extra five g's a month
for just laying in the cut.

176
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:39,000
See how it work?

177
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:41,709
I'm gonna bring you along,
String, but...

178
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,680
it ain'tonna be an overnight thing.

179
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,262
We spend this year
dealing with the city

180
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:49,913
the next doing business
with the state.

181
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:52,738
However, year three?

182
00:11:53,665 --> 00:11:55,518
Then we go for the gold.

183
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:57,735
Then we go federal.

184
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:01,395
Then we see the man
with his hand on the faucet.

185
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:02,451
What faucet?

186
00:12:02,673 --> 00:12:06,294
The hud faucet, the money faucet.

187
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,860
Look, man, I don't know why we got
to wait three years for that shit?

188
00:12:09,884 --> 00:12:11,045
I'm ready to run now.

189
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:12,969
No, you're not.

190
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:16,239
I mean, forgive me, but...

191
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:19,324
you still showin' a little bit of that
street corner mentality.

192
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:21,646
buggin' about every dime you spend

193
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:25,318
about the permits,
about setting up a pac

194
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:28,966
about dropping cash
into re-election war chests

195
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,617
which by the way,
is how i get my gravy.

196
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:35,042
Look, it takes money
to make money, String

197
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:37,306
otherwise, hell,
every pauper'd be a king.

198
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:39,159
You know what I'm saying?

199
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,259
I'm ready to run now.

200
00:12:41,646 --> 00:12:42,538
Three years.

201
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:47,852
Crawl, walk, and then run.

202
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:51,021
Naw man, nappy up there
a little bit more.

203
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:54,916
And the eyes.
He had little beanie eyes.

204
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,142
What the fuck is beanie eyes?

205
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,795
You know, little rat-eyes.

206
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:03,493
Yeah, a-ight.
Yo, put a mole on there.

207
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:05,252
He didn't have a mole.

208
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:06,437
He did too.

209
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,924
You was just too busy shitting
yourself with that whistle

210
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:10,636
to your dome
to see the motherfucker.

211
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:12,231
Shit, fuck I did.

212
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,929
How do you know how to do this?

213
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:17,172
Man, how you don't now
how to do this?

214
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,377
Make his ears stick out.

215
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:21,371
- Why?
- 'Cause I told you to.

216
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:24,609
Ho shit, okay.

217
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,175
Give him light eyes.

218
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:29,392
- Why?
- 'Cause I fuckin' told you to.

219
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:33,861
Okay, can you make 'em cross?

220
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,780
This is fuckin' cool.

221
00:13:37,944 --> 00:13:40,161
Check out these knuckleheads
on the make-a-face.

222
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:50,359
Fuck this shit.

223
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,254
Look, I'm just tryin'
to make my district liveable.

224
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:58,125
Write off a few blocks
in a few places but I save the rest.

225
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:01,064
No offense, but you're like
the blind man and the elephant.

226
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:03,269
It's a lot bigger than what
you got your hand on

227
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:04,196
you just can't see it.

228
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:04,911
See what?

229
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:07,363
A great village of pain,
and you're the mayor.

230
00:14:09,486 --> 00:14:10,801
Where's your drinking water?

231
00:14:11,493 --> 00:14:14,625
Where's your toilets,
your heat, your electricity?

232
00:14:16,232 --> 00:14:21,117
Where's the needle truck, the condom
distribution, the drug treatment intake?

233
00:14:21,706 --> 00:14:23,572
Half these people
are dying on their feet

234
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:25,871
and the other half's
gonna catch what's killin' 'em.

235
00:14:25,902 --> 00:14:28,799
Look, they ain't no worse off
than when they were all over the map.

236
00:14:29,163 --> 00:14:30,641
Now they just in one place is all.

237
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:31,755
And that place is hell.

238
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:43,168
Look, I'm a police.

239
00:14:43,742 --> 00:14:46,734
So I can lock a man up or I can
move his ass off the corner.

240
00:14:48,816 --> 00:14:50,446
Now, you want anything
more than that

241
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:51,948
you're in the wrong shop.

242
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,417
Hey, yo, make her hair
a little bit more straight.

243
00:14:57,661 --> 00:14:58,810
Make it long.

244
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:00,165
With bangs.

245
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,051
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

246
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:05,831
Now chinese up them eyes,
like Beyonce.

247
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:08,670
Get them cheekbones
up a little bit.

248
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,578
Naw, man, that's too much.

249
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:13,088
She startin' to look like
a pie tin with hair now, yo.

250
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:14,156
Hang on.

251
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:16,255
Yeah, alright.

252
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:17,945
Pillow up them lips a little bit.

253
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:20,065
Oh yeah, hook me up with that.

254
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:25,696
Yo, you got one
of these does asses?

255
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:28,476
What?

256
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,255
Yeah, that's what's up, dang.

257
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:37,800
Hey, guys.

258
00:15:39,877 --> 00:15:40,592
How you doing?

259
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:42,990
We're looking
for a cash purchase in here

260
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:45,068
maybe a couple Trac phones,
week or so back.

261
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:46,405
Black guy most likely.

262
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,543
Oh sure, that guy.

263
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:50,604
Every two weeks for him.
Last time, eight phones.

264
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,047
Almost $900.

265
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:54,163
That's a lot of ring dings, no?

266
00:15:55,324 --> 00:15:55,946
Ring dings?

267
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:57,084
A joke.

268
00:16:01,952 --> 00:16:04,394
You got some kind
of transaction record?

269
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,889
Sikh and ye shall find.

270
00:16:13,744 --> 00:16:14,494
Hang on.

271
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:15,808
Hang on.

272
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,486
$927.24.

273
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,026
Can we have the tape for that day?

274
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:25,900
No tape. I rewind every day.

275
00:16:30,486 --> 00:16:31,694
- Keep this?
- Sure.

276
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:34,381
The fuck do we do now?

277
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:36,873
Buy this guy a box of videotapes?

278
00:16:37,436 --> 00:16:40,838
Or camp out in this shithole for a week,
hoping our boy runs the same route?

279
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:50,650
I just know, I got to put my mind
on something or I'm gonna slide back.

280
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:53,571
Need to be in control of myself,
you know what I'm sayin'?

281
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:54,896
Take command of your life.

282
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,603
Something.

283
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:57,738
Cultivate some self-discipline.

284
00:16:57,785 --> 00:16:58,535
Or whatever.

285
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,735
What if I told you that there's
a certain liberation

286
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,796
not in command or in self-control

287
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,417
but in surrendering?

288
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:09,728
Well, that depends on
who you're surrendering to.

289
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:13,318
Oh, that.

290
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:15,910
All due respect?

291
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,237
You can stow that patter
right here and now.

292
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:23,633
Look, it ain't about me
doin' for me, I don't think.

293
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:26,143
Might need to be
about more than that.

294
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:30,902
So you're bringing in an overall decline
of two percent for the month

295
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:33,882
but if I read this correctly,
almost half of that's coming from

296
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:36,029
an eight percent drop
in the western district?

297
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:38,628
Major Colvin is himself
willing to acknowledge

298
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:41,326
the possibility of a statistical
variation from the mean

299
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,468
in his monthly stats.

300
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,037
Variation, huh?

301
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,708
Gentlemen, if I look through
the western incident reports

302
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:51,266
am I likely to find less crime,
or more incidents

303
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:53,330
which have been
downgraded or unfounded?

304
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:57,096
Because this kind of variation
screams manipulation to me.

305
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,299
And if I'm wrong about that

306
00:17:58,323 --> 00:18:00,176
if indeed there is
no manipulation involved

307
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:02,641
I would like to know exactly
what it is that Major Colvin

308
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,586
has learned about police work
that eludes the rest of your commanders.

309
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:08,047
Councilman, I assure you
these stats are not massaged.

310
00:18:08,106 --> 00:18:08,947
We don't do that.

311
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:10,589
I don't do that.

312
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,677
And I won't allow
my people to do that.

313
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:15,305
Our feeling is that
it's genuinely an aberration

314
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:18,092
and if it repeats
itself next month

315
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,533
then it bears closer
examination, otherwise...

316
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:23,736
Moving on to new business then.
How are we fixed for witness assistance?

317
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:25,795
Does the department have
sufficient funds

318
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:28,745
to ensure pre-trial security
for any endangered witnesses?

319
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:34,892
We have the resources that
the city can afford, I'm sure.

320
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:37,508
I understand you're in no
position to criticize the Mayor.

321
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:39,666
- Nor would I.
- Nor would you.

322
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,646
So allow me to ask the question:

323
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:46,113
What is this city willing to pay,
to make it possible for ordinary people

324
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:48,696
to come down to the courthouse
and perform the civic duty

325
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,998
of bearing witness against
gangsters and criminals?

326
00:18:52,227 --> 00:18:55,139
What resources are commensurate
with that kind of commitment?

327
00:18:57,532 --> 00:19:00,031
You can play the good soldier,
if you want, Commissioner.

328
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:01,626
But I want to go on the record here

329
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,805
in saying that this administration
has passed the buck time and again.

330
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:08,505
And failed to protect those citizens
who demonstrate that kind of commitment

331
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:11,039
and put their lives
and livelihood at risk.

332
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:15,004
And I would only like to add,
that I feel as my colleague does

333
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:18,440
that this administration has
failed this community miserably.

334
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:21,384
And we need to do
something about this.

335
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:35,081
Y'all are friends.

336
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:37,123
Y'all like brothers.

337
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:41,052
You lose that you lose
every damn thing.

338
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,035
Kids messed up the good hoop

339
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:52,644
now they got one looks like
the original peach basket

340
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:54,844
an' they hangin' onto it like a tit.

341
00:19:56,756 --> 00:19:57,542
I don't know.

342
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,014
Maybe I should get up
some kind of tournament.

343
00:20:01,753 --> 00:20:03,090
You play basketball?

344
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:05,237
Never was much
for balls and sticks.

345
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:07,099
I was all about my hands.

346
00:20:07,217 --> 00:20:07,791
Boxer?

347
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:08,577
Yeah.

348
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:10,431
Boxing.

349
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:14,032
I know a place where
some of the kids go, but...

350
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,730
it ain't nearly
close enough to here.

351
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,357
I wouldn't mind
takin' a look at it.

352
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,703
Get a mental picture at least.

353
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:23,823
What the hell is goin' on here?

354
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:28,162
Police pushed all the action
down here and a couple other places.

355
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:30,033
The Deacon thinks
that maybe some people

356
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:32,332
should come in here
and take over this situation?

357
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:33,353
You that people?

358
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:35,042
One of 'em, maybe.

359
00:20:36,595 --> 00:20:37,439
Roman, man.

360
00:20:38,014 --> 00:20:38,741
Dennis.

361
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:52,711
You should lay back on this one.

362
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:54,670
Lemme go talk to Buford Pusser
in there alone.

363
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,395
Excuse me?

364
00:20:58,587 --> 00:21:01,214
And what it shows people
is that I know my business

365
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,947
that I will hold people
accountable based on the facts.

366
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:07,291
- This is about what's right.
- There you go again.

367
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:08,100
What?

368
00:21:08,452 --> 00:21:11,098
Do you think politics is only
about winning the argument?

369
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:14,007
That whoever has the right fact
at the right moment wins?

370
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:16,130
Clinton had facts.

371
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,664
Kennedy had facts, yeah.
But Reagan?

372
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:21,703
He couldn't have summoned a fact
if his life depended on it.

373
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,756
It's not just facts,
it's how you use them.

374
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:26,207
And Tommy, when you
get hold of a fact or two

375
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:28,145
you go smartass
and start beating on people.

376
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,973
- That's because...
- Clinton and Reagan?

377
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:31,076
When they got up to speak

378
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:34,508
they gave everyone in the room
comfort and confidence.

379
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:35,951
You liked those guys.

380
00:21:35,963 --> 00:21:38,238
You were happy to think
that they even liked you.

381
00:21:39,728 --> 00:21:41,171
You're saying I'm not likeable?

382
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:43,590
Jen?

383
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:47,871
When you're at home, talking with me

384
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:52,071
not the council, not the cameras,
you're great.

385
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:55,386
When you tell me
what's really important to you

386
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:56,935
I believe.

387
00:21:57,322 --> 00:21:59,303
You're smart and you're ambitious

388
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:01,298
and you've got
a sharper tongue than most.

389
00:22:01,627 --> 00:22:03,961
You can hold court
and you can tell a good story

390
00:22:03,984 --> 00:22:06,319
and you can win
the argument if you want.

391
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:08,813
All of that shows, Tommy

392
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:11,394
and at a Baltimore
city council meeting it shows well

393
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:13,130
but if you want to be mayor

394
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,247
or senator, or governor one day...

395
00:22:17,443 --> 00:22:18,886
...show them something more.

396
00:22:22,323 --> 00:22:23,296
Baltimore, huh?

397
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:27,040
Went up there to the harbor with
my wife for our anniversary?

398
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,551
Charged us $12 for two beers.

399
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:32,014
Shit, that's the least of it.

400
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,993
The whole damn town's
gone to hell in a handbasket

401
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,160
and guess who's running the show?

402
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:37,700
Who?

403
00:22:38,615 --> 00:22:39,530
Who do you think?

404
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:42,779
The department, city hall, the courts.

405
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:44,058
Shit, the courts?

406
00:22:44,386 --> 00:22:46,010
You know what they call it when judge

407
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:48,326
jury and perp all go
to the same family barbecue?

408
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,221
Catch and release.

409
00:22:51,194 --> 00:22:52,074
No shit.

410
00:22:52,344 --> 00:22:54,948
May God have mercy on any poor
white boy going to trial.

411
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:58,150
That's when everybody's got their ass
in the air talking' about justice

412
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:59,910
can't wait to throw away the key.

413
00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:06,946
I mean, they're not all so bad.

414
00:23:08,565 --> 00:23:10,430
Actually, there's a lot of good ones.

415
00:23:12,393 --> 00:23:14,106
I'm on the radio if you need me.

416
00:23:18,763 --> 00:23:20,816
My wife, Carol Ann.

417
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:23,922
Some very good ones.

418
00:23:24,192 --> 00:23:26,221
Is there anything
specific I can help you with

419
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:27,682
while you're down here, detective?

420
00:23:27,711 --> 00:23:29,189
Or is this just a courtesy call?

421
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:33,021
You know, you should meet my partner.
You'd like her.

422
00:23:34,323 --> 00:23:36,153
Can't go through
the front on this boy.

423
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:39,074
So I'm thinkin' we're gonna
have to creep around the back.

424
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,728
Get Devonne on it?

425
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:44,183
I got this for that other problem.

426
00:23:48,957 --> 00:23:51,185
- Who this?
- Remember Fat Face Rick, right?

427
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:53,660
Been going to them co-op
meetings with String?

428
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:54,762
That's his cousin, Trina.

429
00:23:54,786 --> 00:23:56,651
Oh you mean,
Trina with the big old ass.

430
00:23:56,663 --> 00:23:57,437
Yeah, you on it.

431
00:23:57,965 --> 00:24:00,827
That's her work number.
You know where she work nowadays?

432
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,628
She over at the department
of social services.

433
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:05,926
So you thinkin' Omar gettin' a check?

434
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,742
Not now. But i mean
once upon a time, before...

435
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,598
some fool gave lil' Omar
Little a shotgun, I mean

436
00:24:12,714 --> 00:24:14,568
cocksucker was
somebody's child, right?

437
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,879
So I'm thinking somewhere
down in them records

438
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:18,615
is one or two names
of Omar's people.

439
00:24:18,908 --> 00:24:19,835
You feel me?

440
00:24:20,187 --> 00:24:22,496
You sure you want us
on Marlo and Omar both?

441
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,968
I mean, Omar ain't come back
on us since we got his bitch

442
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:29,018
- so maybe...
- Look, I'm home, Charles.

443
00:24:29,147 --> 00:24:30,015
I'm home.

444
00:24:32,316 --> 00:24:32,973
Was up?

445
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,178
Takin' care of business, String?

446
00:24:38,674 --> 00:24:39,683
Me too, man.

447
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:41,184
Me too.

448
00:24:59,503 --> 00:25:01,250
East side wasn't
ready for us, huh?

449
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:03,483
That's what I'm saying.

450
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,153
Yeah, I know all about Baba Jani
and his 24-hour turnover.

451
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:17,006
It's a real pain in my ass too.

452
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,091
He's got a little problem
with the school kids there.

453
00:25:20,114 --> 00:25:21,170
Every afternoon come 3:00

454
00:25:21,182 --> 00:25:22,989
they go in there,
crowd him at the counter

455
00:25:23,329 --> 00:25:24,994
boost all the car
and gun magazines.

456
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:27,274
That surveillance tape's
so grainy now

457
00:25:27,285 --> 00:25:29,584
it's like watching a herd
of buffalo in a snowstorm.

458
00:25:29,807 --> 00:25:32,365
But my insurance man, Bob?

459
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:35,649
Got him to turn this camera here
right on Baba's parking lot.

460
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:38,138
Now anytime I have a real problem?

461
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,050
I just come to Bob
and pull his tape.

462
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,452
I can get a copy of that
for you in the morning.

463
00:25:46,991 --> 00:25:47,625
Your...

464
00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:49,853
Your partner there?

465
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:52,422
Bit of an asshole.

466
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:54,850
For real?

467
00:26:28,142 --> 00:26:29,397
<i>Keep your right hand up. </i>

468
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:40,464
You know what this is?

469
00:26:40,992 --> 00:26:42,153
It's moral midgetry.

470
00:26:43,361 --> 00:26:44,957
Turn the fuckin' world upside down.

471
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,244
Treat these braindead
corner yo's like princelings.

472
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,392
You see how clean the corners are?

473
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,160
In every sector, street traffic
is half of what it was.

474
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,471
Fuck that.
It's wrong, and it's wrong.

475
00:26:54,975 --> 00:26:57,556
Like the other way was right
because we were doing so well.

476
00:26:57,564 --> 00:26:59,071
And Colvin's answer is what?

477
00:26:59,147 --> 00:27:01,704
Ride shotgun for hoppers?
Drown them in cash money paid?

478
00:27:01,728 --> 00:27:03,698
Colvin?
He's always been good police.

479
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:05,634
He's got to know
what a fuckin' heartbreaker

480
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,909
it is to wake up every morning,
suit up for this shit.

481
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:09,276
He's got to suit up too, man.

482
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:12,161
Somebody should dime
the brass about this shit.

483
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:13,886
Or the Sun papers.

484
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:15,258
Let me ask you something.

485
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:17,217
Anybody here ever get jammed up

486
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,223
and not have Colvin
go to the wall for you?

487
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:21,170
The man is trying something.

488
00:27:21,393 --> 00:27:23,340
It may be hard to stomach,
but it's working.

489
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,967
After 30 years don't you think
he's earned the right

490
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,129
to some elbow room on this?

491
00:27:27,176 --> 00:27:29,639
What the fuck. This thing is
on borrowed time anyhow.

492
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:33,302
And when we do decide
to jump on the Hamsterdams

493
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:35,918
they're just gonna go back to
their regular corners, right?

494
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,267
If we ever jump out on it.

495
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:39,789
I don't know that we're gonna.

496
00:27:39,813 --> 00:27:42,050
All I'm sayin' is we give
the guy the same back-up

497
00:27:42,085 --> 00:27:43,540
he's always given us.

498
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:45,534
That's all I'm sayin'.

499
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,257
I swear as soon as the sun comes
up we grab the damn tape and go.

500
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:56,357
This place makes me want to cry.

501
00:27:57,701 --> 00:27:59,977
Hey, I spent half my marriage
in rooms like this.

502
00:28:02,158 --> 00:28:03,191
How could you do it?

503
00:28:04,938 --> 00:28:05,513
What?

504
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,064
Go non-stop hound
on your ex like that.

505
00:28:09,908 --> 00:28:10,553
It was easy.

506
00:28:11,128 --> 00:28:13,509
Just tell her I was on the road
working an extradition.

507
00:28:14,753 --> 00:28:16,078
Lots of extraditions.

508
00:28:17,064 --> 00:28:18,937
Brought back something
like 500 fugitives

509
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,345
in a three-year period, I think.

510
00:28:21,107 --> 00:28:22,187
That's not what I meant.

511
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:24,087
Right.

512
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:32,394
So, you back in the house, huh?

513
00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:36,757
Ate some shit
and she took me back, yeah.

514
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,798
Ain't sure I even want
to be back, though.

515
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:47,872
Extraditions, huh?

516
00:28:50,584 --> 00:28:52,308
Cheryl'd see right
through that shit.

517
00:28:52,437 --> 00:28:53,364
Nah, it's easy.

518
00:28:54,842 --> 00:28:57,798
Just keep your cell off,
make sure she can reach your partner.

519
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,719
Partner tells her:
"Kima's in court" or whatever.

520
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:03,678
Partner calls you at the motel
gives you the heads up

521
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,801
you call her back later like:
"hey, what's up?"

522
00:29:13,553 --> 00:29:16,227
Ain't even have a quarter box
for magic fingers.

523
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:20,813
Maybe you don't need
a quarter box for that.

524
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:22,890
For what?

525
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:25,869
Magic fingers.

526
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:35,683
Hey, you know me.

527
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:39,367
<i>... we'll talk with a singer
songwriter who's burning up</i>

528
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,853
<i>the charts with a hit
he'll perform for us tonight. </i>

529
00:29:58,481 --> 00:29:59,266
You hustlin'?

530
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:00,791
Educatin'.

531
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:05,187
Charging for it or tuition-free?

532
00:30:05,774 --> 00:30:08,859
Tuition will come back to him
ten-fold in acquired wisdom.

533
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:12,194
Besides, nothing in the world's
more expensive than "free".

534
00:30:12,715 --> 00:30:13,700
S'all she wrote.

535
00:30:15,495 --> 00:30:16,586
Let's double it.

536
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:19,718
Naw man, I don't like takin'
money from a church-goin' man.

537
00:30:19,742 --> 00:30:20,375
Triple it.

538
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:21,654
Your break, Deacon.

539
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:29,396
We need to talk
some more about Amsterdam.

540
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,335
Look, man,
I never said it was pretty.

541
00:30:31,523 --> 00:30:33,506
Pretty don't even
come close to the problem.

542
00:30:34,948 --> 00:30:36,168
We need to talk.

543
00:30:40,262 --> 00:30:41,541
I've got comstat meeting.

544
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:44,522
I'll drop by later on.

545
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:50,574
So we good with the permits?

546
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:52,463
Yeah, this week, so far, so good.

547
00:30:52,636 --> 00:30:53,164
A- ight.

548
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:55,311
Look at you.

549
00:30:56,003 --> 00:30:56,413
Who?

550
00:30:57,012 --> 00:30:57,938
Chunky Coates.

551
00:30:58,842 --> 00:30:59,522
Who's that?

552
00:30:59,628 --> 00:31:00,718
You don't know Chunky?

553
00:31:01,352 --> 00:31:03,378
He's got the properties
down the block and over

554
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:04,750
on the even side of Paca Street.

555
00:31:04,832 --> 00:31:07,729
When I first met that fat man,
he had an office so small

556
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,958
you had to leave
the room to change your mind.

557
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,888
Then two years ago he started running
with your man, Clay Davis.

558
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:17,732
Look at you now,
you big sassy bitch.

559
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:20,026
That better?

560
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,763
Hey, special agent Fitzhugh

561
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:26,487
if that is in fact your real name.

562
00:31:28,505 --> 00:31:29,595
FBI in on this?

563
00:31:30,921 --> 00:31:32,633
I am only loved for my toys.

564
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:34,615
Lester called and I delivered.

565
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:35,471
You got the tape?

566
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:40,586
Date of ten-ten-oh-four,
fifteen-oh-four hours

567
00:31:40,597 --> 00:31:42,928
30 seconds, by the register tape.

568
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:50,318
Mama Barksdale?

569
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:54,224
D'Angelo's mother.

570
00:31:54,565 --> 00:31:57,509
She cold-called McNulty
about her son on the jailhouse hangin'.

571
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,266
She's callin' us
on that weak shit?

572
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:01,837
Is this, uh...

573
00:32:02,002 --> 00:32:02,602
Brianna?

574
00:32:03,975 --> 00:32:04,385
Right.

575
00:32:05,629 --> 00:32:07,940
You called about your son.
I'm returning that message.

576
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:12,784
Nothing there.

577
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,077
It's so tiny.

578
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:17,469
No mere mortal can.

579
00:32:20,062 --> 00:32:21,423
You see what he just did?

580
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:25,312
What? He did it again?

581
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:27,071
Who is this man?

582
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:28,490
Where does he come from?

583
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:31,423
Can anybody stop him?
Please don't hurt us.

584
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:35,865
Please my eyes, my eyes.
It's so big and clear and bright.

585
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,555
I'll be at homicide.

586
00:32:38,622 --> 00:32:40,628
Sometimes, you still scare me,
you know that?

587
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:52,249
In my world, do you have
any idea what I had to do

588
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:53,938
to get where I am today?

589
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:58,161
Now when I say i ready,
you best believe it.

590
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:04,457
Through the effective
use of resources

591
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:06,123
an increased police presence

592
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:09,361
and an intensive reach
out into the community

593
00:33:10,534 --> 00:33:13,032
we've been able to have
a significant impact on these areas

594
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:16,175
to the effect
of a 12% decrease overall.

595
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:17,688
12%.

596
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:19,049
Cumulatively.

597
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:20,809
Over four weeks.

598
00:33:21,055 --> 00:33:22,990
Major, I know I gave you shit

599
00:33:23,073 --> 00:33:26,017
when your stats took
a jump a few weeks back

600
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:29,134
but now you're gonna shove
the numbers right up my ass.

601
00:33:30,858 --> 00:33:32,536
It's kind of pouty of you,
isn't it?

602
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,346
12%.

603
00:33:34,261 --> 00:33:36,420
I didn't cook 'em then,
I ain't cookin' 'em now.

604
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:39,470
Seriously, Bunny. I already got
the City Council asking questions

605
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:41,687
about the eight percent drop
you posted last week.

606
00:33:42,496 --> 00:33:45,710
We just want to please the Mayor,
not go to jail behind this shit.

607
00:33:47,748 --> 00:33:49,566
Sometimes the Gods do listen, sir.

608
00:33:49,589 --> 00:33:50,880
Not in the Western they don't.

609
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:52,428
Lieutenant Daniels.

610
00:33:52,885 --> 00:33:53,418
Sir?

611
00:33:53,993 --> 00:33:55,905
You want to take credit
for any of this?

612
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:58,919
Your unit's been working in
that district a couple of weeks.

613
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:00,937
We're barely up on anything.

614
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,635
In fact, the crews we're
looking at are still beefing

615
00:34:03,787 --> 00:34:04,944
still dropping bodies.

616
00:34:05,296 --> 00:34:06,023
Amazing.

617
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:09,355
Crime is down and no one
wants to take any credit.

618
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,267
What is wrong with this picture?

619
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:14,442
You don't mind
if I have planning and research

620
00:34:14,465 --> 00:34:15,626
pull all your C.C. numbers

621
00:34:16,166 --> 00:34:19,357
make sure there's not a decimal point
missing between the one and the two?

622
00:34:19,368 --> 00:34:20,436
Pull everything, Deputy.

623
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:22,172
My number will stand.

624
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:27,161
<i>Hey, tell Landsman, line
twenty-one-oh-three's for him. </i>

625
00:34:34,946 --> 00:34:37,456
I called because I heard
you went and visited Donette

626
00:34:39,063 --> 00:34:41,397
told her my son's death
couldn't have been no suicide.

627
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:42,207
Is that right?

628
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:44,470
I did do that.

629
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,728
D'Angelo hung himself.

630
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:53,010
Not with the belt
they found around his neck.

631
00:34:53,326 --> 00:34:55,820
Not at that distance between
the doorknob and the floor.

632
00:34:57,674 --> 00:34:58,694
So what are you saying?

633
00:35:00,876 --> 00:35:01,744
What am I saying.

634
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:03,445
No.

635
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:06,293
Nobody would've dared.

636
00:35:07,618 --> 00:35:09,648
My brother,
his uncle would have...

637
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:10,551
I agree with you.

638
00:35:12,263 --> 00:35:13,554
Nobody would've dared.

639
00:35:15,395 --> 00:35:16,263
Unless...

640
00:35:18,444 --> 00:35:20,144
Avon and Dee was family.

641
00:35:20,778 --> 00:35:21,822
Family, right.

642
00:35:26,901 --> 00:35:28,425
This is just you talking, right?

643
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:30,794
I mean, anyone else saying that...

644
00:35:30,853 --> 00:35:31,651
Nah, just me.

645
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:33,973
No one else cares.

646
00:35:34,994 --> 00:35:35,440
Right.

647
00:35:36,812 --> 00:35:38,724
It's just, I dunno, on the inside

648
00:35:40,064 --> 00:35:41,308
if somebody's going after you

649
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:44,041
has got a beef, sees red,
they use a shank.

650
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:46,586
It's quick and it's over.

651
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,167
D'Angelo was strangled

652
00:35:50,769 --> 00:35:51,802
which is planned.

653
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:54,558
You need the time,
you need the isolation.

654
00:35:57,667 --> 00:36:00,326
Look, I'm just sorry I brought
this whole mess up to begin with

655
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:02,719
because frankly nobody's
gonna do shit about it anyhow.

656
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,672
Whoever killed him wanted
to pass it off as a suicide

657
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:09,622
and the cops are happy enough
to have one less murder to investigate.

658
00:36:09,658 --> 00:36:12,637
On top of that, the Anne Arundel
State's Attorney doesn't give a fuck

659
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,397
I'm not supposed
to give a fuck, so...

660
00:36:16,954 --> 00:36:19,265
I guess your son just got
squeezed between the sides.

661
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,784
Squeezed between what sides?

662
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,200
Look, two years ago

663
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:29,083
we hung more wire
on your brother's crew than AT&T

664
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:31,765
and at the end, D'Angelo was
this close to flipping.

665
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,220
Giving up everybody, everything.

666
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:34,792
But you know all that right?

667
00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:37,607
You were the one who went down
to that detention center

668
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:39,108
and talked your son out of a deal.

669
00:36:43,116 --> 00:36:44,665
I kinda liked your son, you know?

670
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:49,556
All things considered,
he was a pretty decent kid.

671
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:52,313
And it grinds me that no one
ever spoke up for him

672
00:36:53,697 --> 00:36:55,445
and seems to me
that nobody ever will.

673
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,037
But mostly at this point?

674
00:36:58,084 --> 00:37:01,064
I'm sorry I bothered his girl
and I'm sorry she bothered you.

675
00:37:03,785 --> 00:37:04,618
Why go to her?

676
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:07,738
Why not come to me first?

677
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:09,427
Honestly?

678
00:37:11,351 --> 00:37:13,644
I was looking for somebody
who cared about the kid.

679
00:37:14,471 --> 00:37:15,902
I mean, like I said...

680
00:37:16,758 --> 00:37:19,069
you were the one how made him
take the years, right?

681
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,715
<i>Red leader to red boys. </i>

682
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,190
<i>Red two come in. </i>

683
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,392
<i>Cheese steak has a problem, bitch. </i>

684
00:37:42,152 --> 00:37:43,477
Save me some fries, yo...

685
00:37:44,015 --> 00:37:44,842
<i>You want fries. </i>

686
00:37:45,141 --> 00:37:46,936
<i>I suggest you bring
some cash up here. </i>

687
00:37:48,285 --> 00:37:49,235
You believe this?

688
00:37:50,455 --> 00:37:53,387
No muscle,
it's all out in the open.

689
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:57,198
Naw naw naw, man...

690
00:37:58,019 --> 00:37:59,392
This right here, boy.

691
00:38:00,342 --> 00:38:01,386
This too good.

692
00:38:04,236 --> 00:38:06,751
Hey yo, this some kinda
full-tilt setup, man

693
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,394
to catch some master-scoundrel,
Capone an' whatnot.

694
00:38:10,215 --> 00:38:13,288
Boy, they prob'ly got police behind
every one of those rowhouse windows.

695
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:14,280
Hit this?

696
00:38:15,547 --> 00:38:16,533
You must be trippin'.

697
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,632
Home, James...

698
00:38:21,002 --> 00:38:22,922
I'ma tell you, boy,
you better keep your head

699
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:25,315
back in the game or you gonna
land us both in the pokey.

700
00:39:03,451 --> 00:39:05,199
- What you lookin' at?
- You.

701
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:07,522
Yeah.

702
00:39:08,624 --> 00:39:10,137
I like you're eyes.

703
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:12,390
They like cat's eyes.

704
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:14,079
Who you here with?

705
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:15,263
Them.

706
00:39:17,198 --> 00:39:17,773
That's it?

707
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,201
What kind of cat?

708
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,808
What?

709
00:39:22,371 --> 00:39:23,908
What kind of cat my eyes like?

710
00:39:26,872 --> 00:39:28,033
A big cat.

711
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,054
You here with them
and no one else?

712
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:33,687
I said that.

713
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:35,787
You want to dance?

714
00:39:36,303 --> 00:39:36,872
Hell, no.

715
00:39:37,986 --> 00:39:38,854
You want a drink?

716
00:39:39,394 --> 00:39:40,673
No, don't do that neither.

717
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,454
What do you do?

718
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:06,544
Gene, this spot
I'm telling you about?

719
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:12,128
We're talking TB, HIV, syphilis, herpes, lice...

720
00:40:12,632 --> 00:40:14,497
It's like a five-acre petri dish.

721
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:15,576
You get in there now

722
00:40:16,198 --> 00:40:19,248
you can run every health program
or social program you want.

723
00:40:19,576 --> 00:40:20,996
Every kinda liberal-ass project

724
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,861
never got off the page
it was written on.

725
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:24,831
Jurassic park.

726
00:40:25,415 --> 00:40:27,937
So, you're saying this is a
sanctioned open-air drug market.

727
00:40:27,948 --> 00:40:29,661
No, it's not officially sanctioned.

728
00:40:30,306 --> 00:40:31,679
It's more like it's tolerated.

729
00:40:32,582 --> 00:40:34,928
That's why we came to
you and the public health school

730
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:36,277
not the city health department.

731
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:41,176
Needle exchange, drug outreach,
condoms, HIV-testing.

732
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,109
Y'all ain't never gonna reach
more people in the same spot.

733
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:46,415
So if the city doesn't know about it.
That makes it...

734
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:47,214
Complicated.

735
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:48,574
That means temporary.

736
00:40:48,856 --> 00:40:50,592
You move it or you lose it, boss.

737
00:41:15,357 --> 00:41:16,366
That was nice.

738
00:41:19,124 --> 00:41:20,156
Work for me.

739
00:41:23,511 --> 00:41:24,637
You free tomorrow?

740
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:26,464
Tomorrow?

741
00:41:28,129 --> 00:41:31,625
You could come back to my crib,
nobody's there but my grandma.

742
00:41:32,528 --> 00:41:35,766
Get us a real bed,
take some time with it.

743
00:41:38,183 --> 00:41:39,403
Give me your number.

744
00:41:44,013 --> 00:41:45,902
The reason I'm sayin'
tomorrow not to push

745
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,906
but day after that I got
to go visit my aunt in Florida.

746
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,317
We hook up tomorrow,
I got something real nice

747
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:55,663
to think about
on that long-ass bus ride.

748
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:00,546
After you.

749
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,326
What was it again?

750
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,652
Devonne.

751
00:42:31,517 --> 00:42:33,687
This guys running
his route every five days.

752
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:35,752
That's a shitload of burners.

753
00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:36,491
I don't get it.

754
00:42:37,253 --> 00:42:39,505
They're were so careful
spreading out the purchases

755
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:40,784
up and down the three states

756
00:42:41,077 --> 00:42:43,626
you'd think he'd also
switch up rental agencies.

757
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,972
Maybe the guy felt bad for us.

758
00:42:47,227 --> 00:42:48,400
You got a copier, right?

759
00:43:04,823 --> 00:43:06,606
Damn, girl,
what you lose some weight?

760
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:07,733
Excuse me?

761
00:43:08,049 --> 00:43:09,316
It's just a compliment.

762
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,432
Yo, at's Mrs. Omar?

763
00:43:42,825 --> 00:43:44,104
Yeah, his grandmoms.

764
00:43:44,585 --> 00:43:46,675
So what, we jack her
an' make her talk?

765
00:43:46,921 --> 00:43:50,030
Fool, she probably got no clue
where he lay his head.

766
00:43:52,692 --> 00:43:55,121
Naw, man,
we sit an' we wait, right?

767
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,350
Man, wait on what?

768
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:07,796
You see, if we go upstairs,
we'll spook him.

769
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:09,245
So he's coming down.

770
00:44:10,242 --> 00:44:10,734
Alright.

771
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,953
Russell Bell.

772
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:31,512
I know B-and-B like I know
a thousand other outfits

773
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:33,096
but I don't know him.

774
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,844
Why should I talk to him?

775
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:36,568
Because Russell's a good man.

776
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:39,055
And he's ready to run.

777
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:41,702
Then let him run for you.

778
00:44:42,277 --> 00:44:42,852
Hang on.

779
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,799
Wait a minute, partner.

780
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:47,485
I don't think you know who
you're dealing with here.

781
00:44:47,614 --> 00:44:48,611
You know who that is?

782
00:45:02,543 --> 00:45:03,833
Got your running shoes on?

783
00:45:04,608 --> 00:45:05,241
You're in.

784
00:45:06,062 --> 00:45:07,165
That's the faucet?

785
00:45:07,282 --> 00:45:10,168
Shit, as far as the federal money's
concerned, he's everything.

786
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:11,599
The faucet, the goose...

787
00:45:11,622 --> 00:45:12,291
What goose?

788
00:45:12,697 --> 00:45:14,797
The one that lays them golden eggs.

789
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,070
Madison Square Garden it ain't

790
00:45:35,493 --> 00:45:36,818
but it could work.

791
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,519
You're gonna need
a little help with the clean-up.

792
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:43,763
I'll piece that together.

793
00:45:49,048 --> 00:45:50,327
This my trip, man.

794
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:54,245
Need to go from
"a" to "b" all by my self.

795
00:45:56,356 --> 00:45:57,964
<i>... Am I likely to find less crime</i>

796
00:45:57,999 --> 00:46:01,037
<i>or more incidents that have
been downgraded or unfounded?</i>

797
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,747
<i>Because this kind of variation
screams manipulation to me. </i>

798
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,013
Slow your words.

799
00:46:05,025 --> 00:46:06,855
<i>Indeed there is no
manipulation involved... </i>

800
00:46:06,878 --> 00:46:09,052
Try to lock your eyes
on whoever you talk to.

801
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:11,258
Make them think they matter.

802
00:46:12,184 --> 00:46:15,879
Use open, warm phrases.
nothing sharp, nothing that bites.

803
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:17,088
Where's the fun in that?

804
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:18,904
Do you want this?

805
00:46:24,242 --> 00:46:25,638
<i>What is this city willing to pay</i>

806
00:46:25,673 --> 00:46:27,690
<i>to make it possible
for ordinary people to... </i>

807
00:46:27,726 --> 00:46:28,336
It's me.

808
00:46:28,406 --> 00:46:29,756
<i>Hey, how you cat eyes?</i>

809
00:46:29,826 --> 00:46:31,164
When you say ya leaving again?

810
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,970
<i>Tomorrow, wanna
get together tonight?</i>

811
00:46:32,993 --> 00:46:34,272
Yeah, we can hook up tonight.

812
00:46:35,269 --> 00:46:36,935
<i>How about coming over
to my crib?</i>

813
00:46:37,944 --> 00:46:38,988
Naw, not your crib.

814
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,929
<i>Where then?</i>

815
00:46:40,515 --> 00:46:41,418
Go to a motel.

816
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:43,225
<i>You want me to meet you?</i>

817
00:46:44,175 --> 00:46:44,750
<i>Which one?</i>

818
00:46:44,785 --> 00:46:45,841
I don't know which one.

819
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:48,011
I'll tell you when I see you.

820
00:46:48,457 --> 00:46:49,794
<i>I'd like to see you soon. </i>

821
00:46:50,452 --> 00:46:52,341
Alright, you know the Lake Trout?

822
00:46:52,634 --> 00:46:53,315
<i>Carryout?</i>

823
00:46:53,972 --> 00:46:54,617
<i>Where?</i>

824
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,719
On Woodland.

825
00:46:55,755 --> 00:46:56,974
<i>Off Midtown Road. </i>

826
00:46:57,373 --> 00:46:57,936
That one.

827
00:46:58,089 --> 00:46:59,027
<i>Later this afternoon?</i>

828
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:00,971
<i>I'll be there. </i>

829
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,094
<i>What time you want to meet?</i>

830
00:47:03,434 --> 00:47:04,126
Like five.

831
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:08,044
And five mean five.
I don't truck C.P. time.

832
00:47:08,373 --> 00:47:09,510
Five and change, I'm gone.

833
00:47:10,015 --> 00:47:11,000
<i>I ain't gonna be late. </i>

834
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:11,985
Alright then.

835
00:47:12,504 --> 00:47:13,512
<i>See you then. </i>

836
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,841
What you think about that?

837
00:47:25,104 --> 00:47:25,854
I don't know.

838
00:47:27,543 --> 00:47:29,620
Might be walkin'
into something a little later.

839
00:47:30,493 --> 00:47:32,264
So I'm gonna need
for you to go up there

840
00:47:32,276 --> 00:47:33,273
get me a read up front.

841
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,124
Where's my brother?

842
00:47:44,135 --> 00:47:45,050
Shut the door, man.

843
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,742
Yo, we at war right now, sis.
So he on that.

844
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:51,220
I need to get with him.

845
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:53,182
Well, he ain't on the cell phone

846
00:47:53,205 --> 00:47:55,610
soon as I speak to him,
I'll get him to you, alright?

847
00:47:56,372 --> 00:47:57,533
Can't believe this shit.

848
00:48:02,624 --> 00:48:03,775
Heard from this cop.

849
00:48:04,772 --> 00:48:06,110
He sayin' Dee was murdered.

850
00:48:06,297 --> 00:48:08,409
Oh, that'd be McNulty.

851
00:48:09,781 --> 00:48:10,825
How you know?

852
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:14,096
Levy figured he couldn't
talk you out of that meet

853
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,396
but I sure wish he'da tried.

854
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,188
I need to get with my brother.

855
00:48:18,352 --> 00:48:19,103
Oh, c'mon.

856
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:22,071
This fucking cop.

857
00:48:23,262 --> 00:48:24,998
He trying to drive
a wedge up in here.

858
00:48:25,256 --> 00:48:26,136
You can't see it.

859
00:48:32,811 --> 00:48:34,371
Look, I can imagine
how hard it is

860
00:48:34,395 --> 00:48:36,788
for a mother to have to deal
with some shit like that.

861
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:39,873
No doubt. But the fact is,
these places, they press on niggers.

862
00:48:41,468 --> 00:48:43,779
Dee just figured a way
to get out of there early.

863
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,113
Ain't nothing nobody
could do about that.

864
00:48:49,374 --> 00:48:51,509
I mean, how do you
protect a man from himself?

865
00:48:52,272 --> 00:48:53,199
Where Avon at?

866
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:54,559
I'll go to him.

867
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:57,978
I told you. We beefin' for corners
right now and as soon as I speak to him

868
00:48:58,002 --> 00:48:59,304
I'll get him to you, I promise.

869
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:06,338
A cop shouldn't mess
with a mother's pain like that.

870
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:07,335
No one should.

871
00:49:20,063 --> 00:49:22,081
Yeah, let me get
four trout on white

872
00:49:22,479 --> 00:49:25,283
extra mayo on one,
hot sauce on two

873
00:49:25,306 --> 00:49:27,778
and the other with ketchup,
and four orange sodas.

874
00:50:07,955 --> 00:50:10,688
This clown ass nigger went
and got four sammiches.

875
00:50:10,723 --> 00:50:12,330
Four sodas, you heard me?

876
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:13,574
Cool.

877
00:50:19,322 --> 00:50:21,926
Niggas don't roll out in a few
minutes, we on to something.

878
00:50:27,135 --> 00:50:28,847
<i>Drop one, get one. </i>

879
00:50:30,047 --> 00:50:31,760
Nah, baby, this one's sentimental.

880
00:50:32,288 --> 00:50:33,320
Here, it's bleach.

881
00:50:33,637 --> 00:50:35,607
Just soak your works
and you're good to go.

882
00:50:37,906 --> 00:50:39,290
<i>Drop one get one. </i>

883
00:50:41,475 --> 00:50:42,859
<i>Drop one, get one. </i>

884
00:50:44,513 --> 00:50:45,989
Get the other girls to come by.

885
00:50:49,555 --> 00:50:50,047
Or wait.

886
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:53,965
Just pass these out for me, okay?

887
00:50:57,704 --> 00:50:59,417
Yo, I get swoled up
from Peanut Butter.

888
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,425
You got anything else?

889
00:51:00,449 --> 00:51:02,296
The fuck I look like to you,
Chef Boyardee?

890
00:51:02,308 --> 00:51:02,659
Who?

891
00:51:02,678 --> 00:51:05,892
Hey, when all this bullshit falls apart,
I'm gonna kick your fucking...!

892
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:38,242
Go by them slow.

893
00:51:59,131 --> 00:51:59,952
Oh shit!

894
00:52:01,443 --> 00:52:02,346
<i>Oh, my god!</i>

895
00:52:04,176 --> 00:52:04,634
You hit?

896
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:05,830
No.

897
00:52:05,983 --> 00:52:07,918
Drive, motherfucker,
get out of here!

898
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:28,708
Your man better be
as good as his word.

899
00:52:29,635 --> 00:52:30,327
Or your word.

900
00:52:34,725 --> 00:52:37,434
If you are still in possession
of that kind of mentality?

901
00:52:37,892 --> 00:52:39,534
Then you are definitely not ready.

902
00:52:40,355 --> 00:52:41,610
- String?
- Not now.

903
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:43,252
- It's Avon...
- Shut the door.

904
00:52:48,551 --> 00:52:49,231
Let's do this.

905
00:52:54,827 --> 00:52:55,871
I'll be in touch, partner.

906
00:52:59,132 --> 00:53:00,821
- What is it, man?
- Avon's been hit.

907
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:02,077
- Where?
- In the shoulder.

908
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,185
Tater got kilt, but Avon
still breathin', man.

909
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:07,955
But Brianna all over me,
calling me, man.

910
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,844
- I need to tell her.
- Naw, fuck Brianna.

911
00:53:09,891 --> 00:53:10,336
What?

912
00:53:10,407 --> 00:53:12,518
Just keep the bitch
away from me, ya hear me?

913
00:53:24,129 --> 00:53:26,135
If you put them
pitbull-style stitches in me

914
00:53:26,147 --> 00:53:27,484
the next patient's gonna be you.

915
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:28,892
For real.

916
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,593
What, you don't like rawhide?

917
00:53:31,871 --> 00:53:33,115
Oooh, Marlo.

918
00:53:34,804 --> 00:53:36,810
We're finally gettin'
back to old times, baby.

919
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,187
Hey, Anthony, where you at?

920
00:53:51,965 --> 00:53:54,429
First-floor, 10-34 North Mount, sir.

921
00:53:57,279 --> 00:53:57,819
Good.

922
00:54:08,235 --> 00:54:10,111
They expecting us to hit back wild.

923
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:11,831
That's what they just waiting for

924
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,790
and we're gonna sit
back on it for awhile

925
00:54:13,791 --> 00:54:14,800
let 'em sweat on it.

926
00:54:15,105 --> 00:54:16,031
Yo, we gotta talk.

927
00:54:16,407 --> 00:54:17,028
Hold on.

928
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:21,344
I mean, he got to come out on his corners,
that's how he make money, right?

929
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,562
We gonna see who got
the bigger war chest. Avon.

930
00:54:34,415 --> 00:54:36,011
Straight to the mattresses, huh?

931
00:54:36,222 --> 00:54:37,524
Whatever, what you want, man?

932
00:54:37,536 --> 00:54:39,143
War, man, we're past this bullshit.

933
00:54:39,483 --> 00:54:40,914
Oh yeah, I forgot.

934
00:54:41,395 --> 00:54:42,935
I knew I forgot something.

935
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:44,061
We the Trump brothers.

936
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:46,138
You don't give this shit up

937
00:54:46,689 --> 00:54:48,836
you're gonna turn
everything we built to shit.

938
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:49,786
Naw.

939
00:54:51,006 --> 00:54:52,707
The chump brothers.

940
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:56,750
You know what the difference's
between me and you?

941
00:54:56,761 --> 00:54:57,829
I bleed red

942
00:54:58,298 --> 00:54:59,248
you bleed green.

943
00:54:59,846 --> 00:55:01,242
What you been building for us?

944
00:55:02,145 --> 00:55:04,245
I look at you these days
you know what I see?

945
00:55:04,491 --> 00:55:05,946
I see a man without a country.

946
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:08,890
Not hard enough for this right here

947
00:55:08,948 --> 00:55:11,224
and maybe, just maybe

948
00:55:11,353 --> 00:55:13,394
not smart enough
for them out there.

949
00:55:13,453 --> 00:55:14,462
Not hard enough.

950
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:15,717
No offense.

951
00:55:15,787 --> 00:55:17,465
I don't think you ever really were.

952
00:55:18,122 --> 00:55:20,609
You got skills, yeah,
no doubt, but... what?

953
00:55:21,641 --> 00:55:23,576
What, 'cause I don't
shoot up a block

954
00:55:23,846 --> 00:55:25,582
indiscriminate I ain't hard enough?

955
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:28,062
Huh? Because I think

956
00:55:29,001 --> 00:55:31,335
before I snatch a life,
I ain't into this bullshit?

957
00:55:31,898 --> 00:55:32,661
Snatch a life.

958
00:55:34,643 --> 00:55:35,875
What life you snatch, huh?

959
00:55:43,497 --> 00:55:46,265
You know Brianna went downtown,
man, saw that detective.

960
00:55:47,673 --> 00:55:51,579
Man stokin' her head sayin' that
D'Angelo's death was no suicide.

961
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:54,344
Yeah, so...

962
00:55:56,374 --> 00:55:57,652
Man ain't wrong about that.

963
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:02,698
What?

964
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:10,006
I knew you couldn't do it

965
00:56:11,531 --> 00:56:13,173
and Brianna wouldn't do that shit.

966
00:56:16,565 --> 00:56:18,947
But there goes a life
that had to be snatched, Avon.

967
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:35,312
Yo man, I took that shit off you
and put it on me, man

968
00:56:35,335 --> 00:56:37,881
because that motherfucker
was out of pocket with that shit!

969
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:39,699
20 years above his fucking head.

970
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:42,769
He flip, man, they got you,
me and fucking Brianna!

971
00:56:42,781 --> 00:56:44,224
And no fucking way, man.

972
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,115
Hell no!

973
00:56:45,749 --> 00:56:47,649
Now, I know you family.

974
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:48,928
You loved that nigger.

975
00:56:48,951 --> 00:56:51,661
But you want to talk that blood
is thicker than water bullshit

976
00:56:51,684 --> 00:56:53,362
take that shit
somewhere else, nigger!

977
00:56:53,385 --> 00:56:54,922
That motherfucker woulda taken down

978
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:57,162
the whole fucking show
starting with you, killer!

979
00:56:59,426 --> 00:57:01,854
It's fucking everything
and everybody!

980
00:57:08,505 --> 00:57:09,174
Let me up.

981
00:57:17,113 --> 00:57:17,652
Let me up.

982
00:57:23,881 --> 00:57:24,487
Shit.

983
00:58:27,784 --> 00:58:29,345
