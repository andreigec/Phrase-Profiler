1
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:21,550
Freezing my balls off.

2
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:26,415
It ain't so bad. Loosen up.
Couple more months, it's gonna be spring.

3
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,892
Spring, huh?

4
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:33,825
Listen, you gotta realize the bosses
did you a favor sending you down here.

5
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:37,425
- Citywide to Marine Unit.
- 7672. Go ahead.

6
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:42,874
Distress call from a private craft.
60-foot white vessel. Engines are dead.

7
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:45,309
What's the location, Citywide?

8
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:50,114
In the channel near the bridge.
About 2,000 yards off the Armistead pier.

9
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:53,217
10-4, we're responding.

10
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:16,604
My father used to work there.

11
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:18,870
- Beth Steel?
- In the shipyards there, yeah.

12
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:23,312
I had an uncle who was a supervisor there.
Got laid off in '78, though.

13
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:25,307
'73 for my dad.

14
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,885
- Party boat?
- Pretty one, yeah.

15
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,084
- More than one engine, right?
- Probably an electrical problem.

16
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,543
Is that a police boat?

17
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,786
How are you tonight? Good to see you.

18
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,320
Henry, how are you?

19
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,654
- Drink?
- No, thanks.

20
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,321
- You're the Captain?
- Yeah.

21
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,365
- Harbormaster?
- No, City Police.

22
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:18,670
- So you're dead in the water?
- Think it's the starter.

23
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,704
- You're not a mechanic, are you?
- Me? No.

24
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:23,968
I can't tell the aft from the stern.

25
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,578
Best I can offer you is a tow line.

26
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,345
Claude, looks like they're gonna need a pull.

27
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:33,282
- 10-4, we'll tow to Henderson's.
- That'll work.

28
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,046
Any chance you can hold off
on bringing us in?

29
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,419
Lot of partying going on now.

30
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:42,255
I wouldn't wanna cut it short
for a little engine trouble.

31
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:44,625
You're in the shipping channel.

32
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:59,334
You tow us somewhere out of the way,
and the band plays on a while longer.

33
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,534
...because you see what I'm saying, right?

34
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,037
I mean, three years in auto theft
and I didn't learn anything.

35
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,299
I didn't care.

36
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:11,240
I'm telling you,
I didn't even wanna be a police anymore.

37
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:12,674
I honestly didn't.

38
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,914
I think that was why
I shot up my car like I did.

39
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:20,210
But this thing we did on Barksdale,
the wiretap and all...

40
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:24,283
that felt like something.
That felt like something I wanna do.

41
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,190
So I was thinking, you know,
narcotics, maybe.

42
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,695
Major, you want this stuff where?

43
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:33,697
Just in here.
Up against the wall over there.

44
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:37,361
If there aren't any openings
in the regular narcotics shift...

45
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,938
maybe assets forfeiture
or something like that.

46
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,337
Easy. Everything breaks.

47
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:45,743
I mean, with this Barksdale thing...

48
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,781
Lester Freamon had us deep into the money.
Real deep.

49
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:53,875
We could've seized real estate, cash,
vehicles, all kinds of stuff.

50
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:57,820
If the bosses, I mean,
if command had let that case go forward.

51
00:05:57,923 --> 00:05:59,390
We were on it.

52
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,827
- Look at that. It's the dove.
- Right.

53
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,866
- So what do you think?
- What do I think?

54
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:15,398
I think you're gonna take
the Sergeant's Exam next month.

55
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,577
And because I have Andy Krawczyk's ear...

56
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:23,273
and because he has City Hall's ear...

57
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,640
you're gonna make Sergeant.

58
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,721
Then you're gonna come out here
to the Southeast...

59
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:33,189
where, because I'm your father-in-law...

60
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:37,886
you're gonna be assigned a daytime shift
in a quiet sector.

61
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,556
Then you're gonna take the Lieutenant's
Exam where you'll also score high.

62
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,602
I don't want to make rank.

63
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:47,537
I want to work cases. Good cases.

64
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:49,767
Roland.

65
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,079
Listen to me.

66
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:59,880
You did good with the drug thing.
You buckled down, you did the work.

67
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:02,545
And except for that thing
with the Grand Jury...

68
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,522
you helped take
some of the stink off yourself.

69
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:08,787
Now if you'll just shut up and listen to me...

70
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,893
you might actually have a career
in this department.

71
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:23,902
- This radio ain't working that well.
- We're losing it.

72
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,243
- We're losing the station, man.
- What you mean?

73
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,281
We done gone so far from Baltimore,
we're losing the station.

74
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:34,512
- Try a Philly station or some shit like that.
- The radio in Philly is different?

75
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,713
Nigger, you gotta be fucking with me, right?

76
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,915
You never heard a station
outside of Baltimore?

77
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:42,960
I ain't never left Baltimore
except that Boys' Village shit one day.

78
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,054
And I wasn't trying to hear no radio
up in that bitch.

79
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,729
Come on, man. You're killing me. Stop.

80
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,537
It's been perfect tomato weather out there.

81
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,670
These wonderful hot, humid days,
and then rain at night.

82
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,613
- This a Philly station?
- How the fuck would I know?

83
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:10,211
Why would anybody wanna leave Baltimore?
That's what I'm asking.

84
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:13,285
Yo, that be the exit. Take that shit.

85
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,112
So far they on it.

86
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,981
Ahoy, matey.

87
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,217
The girls always tell me
about the little man in the boat.

88
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,153
- Now I know who they talking about.
- Come on board, man.

89
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:53,451
- Come on, I wanna show you.
- Fuck, no.

90
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,686
- What's the matter?
- The Bunk can't swim.

91
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:58,024
I ain't too good at floating, either.

92
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,696
So what brings you to the water's edge?

93
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,569
Ilene Nathan called.
Gant case is coming up in four weeks.

94
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,763
She wants to start doing preliminaries
on our witnesses.

95
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:11,331
That means the old lady from the projects,
which is no problem.

96
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,968
And your man Omar, who's in the wind.

97
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,609
You got a line on Omar, Jimmy?

98
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:23,982
- Well, he's not to starboard.
- That's port, fool.

99
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,254
- How the fuck would you know?
- Come on.

100
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,590
Let me buy you lunch
and we can think on this shit together.

101
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,459
I leave, I gotta tell my Sergeant.

102
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:36,500
That reminds me. Landsman wants his $10.

103
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,034
- What for?
- For betting that you'd ride the boat.

104
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:43,535
You tell that motherfucker
he's not gonna see that money...

105
00:10:43,642 --> 00:10:47,408
especially since it was probably him
told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.

106
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,175
- Ain't the same up there without your ass.
- No?

107
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,647
Better, actually.

108
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,183
Hey, come on, now.

109
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,117
The canal gets dredged...

110
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:01,158
it means we all work.
Your people, my people.

111
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,057
The canal's the key, Nat. You know this.

112
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,630
Yeah, but you know how much money
you're gonna spend...

113
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,494
to even get them talking about that shit?

114
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:10,727
We don't take a shot,
we might as well roll over and die right now.

115
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,997
No, you get them to rebuild the grain pier.

116
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,869
- You got a 100 ships right there.
- That's break-bulk, Nat.

117
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:19,034
Best you'll do is one or two
extra gangs a week on them blowers.

118
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:20,941
That's six or seven-man gangs at best.

119
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:24,880
But you try for that, you might actually
come away with something.

120
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:27,747
You go down to Annapolis
asking for the goddamn canal...

121
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,789
you gonna come back with nothing but
your little shriveled-ass dick in your hand.

122
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,690
What's more,
if the grain pier don't get fixed up soon...

123
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:39,355
some asshole's gonna fuck us
by building condominiums all over it.

124
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,923
- Nat, if the canal were 2 feet deeper--
- Fuck the canal.

125
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,195
I'm going to the District Council.

126
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm gonna tell them
to push for the grain pier.

127
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,507
- You feel me?
- Nat, calm the fuck down.

128
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:55,239
Goddamn Checkers Local always acting
like you're the king of everything and shit.

129
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,605
Nat, listen to me. If we--

130
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,048
Y'all need to crawl back down
in them holds...

131
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,315
and remind yourself of who you is
and where you come from.

132
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,790
Damn, Frank.

133
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:14,257
We just sat here and watched Nat Coxson
take a shit all over you.

134
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,802
And shrivel-dick motherfucker
that you are, you take it.

135
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,927
For your information...

136
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:22,302
I wake up every morning
with an angry, blue-veined diamond-cutter.

137
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:25,934
I was gonna enlighten the president
of Local 47 on this particular point...

138
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:27,909
and he chose to depart.

139
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:36,211
- Blue steel, gentlemen.
- For Christ's sake.

140
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,290
Three-and-a-half inches of hard blue steel.

141
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:31,534
- Nicky boy, you working today?
- As a lasher for Big Roy's crew.

142
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,105
Attaboy. Make the family proud.

143
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:38,411
First day they give me in two weeks.

144
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,978
- Is Ott around?
- On his ass as usual.

145
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,215
Worthless fuck still owes me $20
for them lotto tickets.

146
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,458
Hey, Nick.

147
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,368
You need to see the Greek
and get a number. He's got one on the way.

148
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,028
- Today?
- Tomorrow.

149
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:02,541
The Atlantic Light over at North Point.

150
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:05,873
All right.

151
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,011
- Yo, Frank.
- What's up?

152
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,884
You gotta get with Ziggy, man.
He's all over the place.

153
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,095
I'm here since 8:00.
You know I been here since 8:00.

154
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:29,823
- Hold your horses.
- You fucking goose.

155
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:33,236
I'm gonna find it for you.
Just shut the fuck up a minute.

156
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:34,703
How we doing?

157
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:37,036
- Ain't a problem, Chief.
- The fuck it ain't.

158
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,406
I'm down here since 8:00
for crane-to-chassis...

159
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,674
- and Tweety Bird here lost the can.
- It ain't lost.

160
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,441
It's right here on the manifest as a hot box.
Where is it, Zig?

161
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,946
- It's either in Bay 7, or--
- Bay 7 is empty, man.

162
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,658
Or it ain't. In that case...

163
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:59,458
it's definitely somewhere in the stacks.

164
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:00,656
Jesus fucking Christ.

165
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,394
You're killing me here, Ziggy.
You are fucking killing me.

166
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,903
Get me a number for your shipping agent.
I'll call and try to square it.

167
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:08,233
And you.

168
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,999
You clock out today and leave your box,
and don't ever come the fuck back.

169
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,078
You hear me, Zig? You're fired.

170
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,010
Later for you, goofus.

171
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,142
Fucking guy.
He loses his job and he couldn't care less.

172
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,219
- He ain't fired, man.
- No?

173
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,950
That's his father.

174
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,641
How fast you need this?

175
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,439
Case goes to trial in a month.
Got to start prepping it this week.

176
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:55,809
Officer Burns.

177
00:15:58,690 --> 00:15:59,987
Detective.

178
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,524
I heard they posted you down here.

179
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,757
But, I mean, you know, damn.

180
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,464
These motherfuckers don't play, do they?

181
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,964
So what brings you downstairs?

182
00:16:15,073 --> 00:16:18,304
I was pulling evidence on the Gant case.

183
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,446
You know, trial date for Bird is next month
and Ilene Nathan wanted to be ready.

184
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,276
You give him my love.

185
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,178
- Who?
- Bird.

186
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,825
- No evidence.
- What do you mean, no evidence?

187
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:38,123
Submission slip says
"Row BB, Section 14, Shelf 3...

188
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,027
"Four, Right rear." It says that.

189
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,861
- So?
- No such thing.

190
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,596
BB has 12 sections. This says 14.
You see what I'm saying?

191
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:47,970
No evidence.

192
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:58,376
Winters kill off
the weaker varieties of caterpillars.

193
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:03,310
- Fuck me.
- ...that's of an entirely different breed...

194
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,480
Fuck.

195
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,600
...protection against caterpillars,
they eat right through it.

196
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:20,637
But it is a sort of a warning system.

197
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,673
They here.

198
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,885
Franoosh, you made it.

199
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,481
Right, Father. Got you covered here.

200
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,784
Come on.

201
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:22,156
You wanna see your window?

202
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:30,166
Only Franoosh Sobotka would send
all the way to Esslingen for stained glass.

203
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:35,775
The Germans are hard-headed,
but you can't beat them for craft.

204
00:18:37,949 --> 00:18:41,385
I was glad to do it, Father,
for the church, you know.

205
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:45,155
Truth is I need to ask you
something in return.

206
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,884
Anything I can do.

207
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:50,255
- I need some face time with the Senator.
- Barbara?

208
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:54,455
She comes to the early mass on Sunday,
the one in Polish.

209
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,090
We got nothing but problems, Father.

210
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,499
We need to see something happen
with the C&D Canal...

211
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:00,503
and the grain pier's been down for a year.

212
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:04,405
I got tough guys coming in
to confess things I never heard before.

213
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,306
I don't need you to tell me
how bad things are at the docks.

214
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,280
So you'll set something up
with Mikulski soon?

215
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:15,146
You didn't need a German window
to ask me for that, Francis.

216
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,048
And what's more...

217
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:19,589
you've made offerings
way above what it would take...

218
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,784
to get that window up there.

219
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:27,654
How long since your last confession?

220
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,333
I'll see you, Father.

221
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,407
This shit might be somewhere else, man.

222
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,544
Yo, the shit is always up in the door, man.

223
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,711
Motherfucker, you been
standing there watching us.

224
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,080
You see any shit come up out of there?

225
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,047
You seen we ain't take shit up off this car.

226
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,248
- All right.
- You seen it.

227
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,155
Who gonna believe us? This shit is missing.

228
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,760
And fuck what you're saying.

229
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:59,386
All he's gonna hear
is that this shit is fucking missing.

230
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:00,521
Yo, check it again.

231
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,499
Yo, the shit ain't there, man.
Call your man and say so.

232
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,160
Nigger, what you say?

233
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,728
- I said check it again, God damn it!
- Whoa, chill.

234
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,308
Yo, man, cut that shit the fuck out.

235
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:16,372
What the fuck is going on today, man?

236
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:21,979
Taking their time, ain't they?

237
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,465
What the hell is going on?

238
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,473
Come on, man.

239
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,666
Damn!

240
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,548
- Ain't anywhere in this section either.
- Start on the next row.

241
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,186
Lieutenant, those two bags could be
anywhere in this damn basement.

242
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:56,617
You're right.

243
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,488
- We could be here all night.
- Right again.

244
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,554
So that's overtime, right?

245
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,265
Fuck me. I still cannot type.

246
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,409
Fucking white boys, I love them.
I fucking love them.

247
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,241
- Yeah?
- Dumb as a box of rocks.

248
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:24,642
- Who?
- White boys.

249
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,408
Talking about the brain-deads
in my Kane Street case.

250
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,953
I call him up,
I tell him I wanna buy some drugs.

251
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,317
You know what he says?

252
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,153
"Okay, I'll sell you the drugs.
How much drugs do you want?"

253
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:38,059
I swear to God, Kima, they don't code it,
they don't ask for a meet, nothing.

254
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:41,223
And then when you make the deal,
there's no runner, no bullshit.

255
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:43,562
It's the guy himself
walking up to you, saying:

256
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,966
"I brought the drugs.
Did you bring the money?"

257
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,733
I'm not kidding.
I have much respect for black people...

258
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,808
after working with these idiots
for two weeks.

259
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:55,073
If white boys wanna sell drugs in Baltimore,
they have to make different laws for it...

260
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,670
like even it out for them.

261
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:59,841
- Affirmative action.
- Leave no white man behind.

262
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,053
- What the fuck do you want?
- I need you to do the seizures.

263
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:07,420
You got titles, deeds, registrations?
What do you have for me?

264
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:10,119
Thought you did that.
You're the Forfeiture Unit, right?

265
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,254
I write all the affidavits
and the filing for the City Solicitor.

266
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:16,197
But you've gotta give me the information
on what we're taking.

267
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,235
That's a fucking hassle.

268
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:21,032
You want the property, do the paperwork.

269
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:25,007
You gotta step up, Herc.
You don't have me or Carver to lean on here.

270
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,134
No?

271
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,275
How about you come
on the raids tomorrow?

272
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,314
Take a few doors with me
for old time's sake.

273
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,440
You taking doors?

274
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,110
Yeah, two houses and a bar on Kane Street.

275
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,519
Come on, Kima, mount up with us.
I know you miss it.

276
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,126
I'm done rolling around the gutter.
I am inside now.

277
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,890
- You're a housecat now?
- I made a promise.

278
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,129
I gotta say, Kima. If you were a guy...

279
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,366
and, actually, in some ways
you're better than most guys I know.

280
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:59,739
If you were a guy, your friends
would buy you a beer and let you know.

281
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:02,813
- Let me know what?
- You're fucking whipped.

282
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,912
- Whipped?
- Pussy-whipped within an inch of your life.

283
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:07,507
I kid you not.

284
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,552
So...

285
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,919
So?

286
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,503
So where do we find Omar?

287
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:29,497
Who?

288
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,412
- He say anything else?
- No.

289
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,443
Just to come back. All of us.

290
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,079
How he say it?

291
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,391
You know, he just said it.

292
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,092
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

293
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,145
Shit.

294
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:39,401
- They holding to it?
- So far.

295
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:43,143
All right.

296
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,020
They got the times right?

297
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,452
How about the mileage?

298
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,460
All right.

299
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:11,206
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

300
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,975
- You never saw him out the car?
- No.

301
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:17,971
- You stayed with him the whole time?
- Every minute.

302
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,816
How long before he came out
the parking garage?

303
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,652
- How long was he on his own?
- Not enough time to do shit, String.

304
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,783
He was in and out, like, in three minutes.

305
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:30,087
Chill.

306
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,295
- This shit is fucked up.
- Look--

307
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,664
You follow the directions?

308
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,170
- I did just like you told me.
- Wrote down the mileage?

309
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:42,899
- Yeah.
- Let me see.

310
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,405
See, right there.

311
00:25:55,486 --> 00:25:58,421
No, you're three-tenths of a mile long, dawg.

312
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,387
And if you followed directions,
you wouldn't be.

313
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:05,960
String, I did everything like I should, man.
I swear.

314
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,412
You got answers?

315
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:35,091
You didn't have to take a detour
in Camden...

316
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:38,287
when they shut down a couple of blocks
on the Boulevard?

317
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,927
You hurt your foot?

318
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:45,669
- My foot?
- You know, the way you kicked that tire jack.

319
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:53,835
- You was on us the whole time?
- Who, me?

320
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,140
Y'all had people following us.

321
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,309
So where it at?

322
00:27:05,656 --> 00:27:08,250
You know, you should take me with you.

323
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,894
I should meet these guys.
If I meet these guys...

324
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:15,898
we can figure out ways to do business.
You know what I'm saying?

325
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,330
- Zig, these guys are real.
- What, I ain't real?

326
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,411
Six degrees.

327
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,982
Everybody's going home
to sauerkraut and Santy Claus...

328
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,381
and here comes a gang of us
walking the other way...

329
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:37,818
Little Big Roy with his wooden leg.

330
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:40,390
- Christ, them wooden shovels.
- Yeah.

331
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,585
You children don't know nothing
about them wooden shovels, do you?

332
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:45,855
Can't have no sparks
when you working grain.

333
00:27:45,963 --> 00:27:48,397
- Kaboom.
- It's more like kaput.

334
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:52,196
You never gonna see another grain ship
here in Bawlmer, my friends.

335
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,498
Zig, you believe these fucking dinosaurs?

336
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:58,837
They sit around all day talking shit about
how they used to off-load with shovels...

337
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:02,276
and carry fucking railroad cars
on their backs.

338
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,644
Shit, and drink whiskey through a fire hose.

339
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:08,344
Go home and fuck their wives till breakfast.
There was some heroes back then.

340
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,546
Shit is thick in here tonight, gentlemen.

341
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,283
What can you do?
This generation, they just don't know.

342
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:15,985
- Ain't never gonna be what it was.
- No, indeed.

343
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:19,791
Every night with these old fucks.
It's like 1952 and shit.

344
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,131
Boys, you know, when I was your age,
I unloaded ten ships a goddamn day.

345
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:28,568
You know, I'd do it with one arm...

346
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:31,870
after a 300-pound bag of Polish dildos
fell on me.

347
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:35,143
Whoa, wait. What the fuck is a Polish dildo?

348
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,578
Actually, at my house, it's a ring of kielbasa.

349
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,843
Christ, here we go again.

350
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,416
Bring out pretty boy.

351
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,854
But, you know, where you boys hail from,
I'm sure any old breakfast link will do.

352
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,392
You know he's gonna
pull out his dick, right?

353
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,018
That boy ain't right.

354
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,494
It was just me...

355
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,566
and my old wooden leg,
and my old wooden shovel...

356
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:58,533
and my glass eye, and my Polish pencil.

357
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:02,868
Like anyone from the Checkers Local
ever used anything but a real pencil.

358
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,636
Shit, they don't even push
one of them no more.

359
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,706
Talking trash about 1514.

360
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:14,649
Jesus H. Christ, you know what?
All hands starboard.

361
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,652
Come on.

362
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,625
The old tub is listing. Can you feel her?

363
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,126
You wanna know why?

364
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:27,425
'Cause them old fucks
done unloaded so much bullshit...

365
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,000
that this whole motherfucker's
gonna capsize.

366
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,126
Brace yourselves, we're sinking.

367
00:29:32,703 --> 00:29:34,364
God damn it, Ziggy.

368
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,804
You're not taking your dick out
in here again.

369
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:41,242
Let me show you old gents some bulk cargo
that none of you could ever handle.

370
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,308
Who says they don't make them
like they used to?

371
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,715
Pretty boy is on the town tonight.

372
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,187
Fucking Ziggy, man.

373
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,816
- Bring her in the boat?
- Hell, no.

374
00:31:34,191 --> 00:31:37,922
- She'll fall apart if we try to bring her in.
- What's the plan then?

375
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,556
We'll hook her real good.
We'll tow her slowly over to the pier.

376
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,096
- What's she look like?
- What do you mean?

377
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:48,228
- How long you think she's been in?
- She's fresh.

378
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:52,703
- Legs are broke, though.
- Probably a jumper from the bridge.

379
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,640
All right, Ma. Shit.

380
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,952
Kitchen's closed.

381
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:48,859
There's no service for drunks
who can't get up in time to catch a ship.

382
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:50,024
What ship?

383
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,796
Your father says the Talco Line is in today.

384
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:55,428
That makes two ships at North Point.

385
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:01,105
It's the Atlantic Light.
Ain't due until this afternoon.

386
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:03,212
That still is no excuse.

387
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,120
Good morning, Mom.

388
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:21,995
Couple of goddamn drunks I got.

389
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:27,132
And don't leave
without taking your cousin with you.

390
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:31,265
I gotta clean in there,
and I ain't gonna do it around his carcass.

391
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:12,581
You keep us guessing, don't you, Stan?

392
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,844
At Sunday mass, you can't be found.

393
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,648
But early on a Tuesday,
you arrive with an army.

394
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:22,556
$2,500 from myself and every other Polack...

395
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,322
in three districts and four firehouses.

396
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,726
- And to what do we owe such generosity?
- A surprise.

397
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,859
We ordered up a window
for where you renovated the nave.

398
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,096
A memorial. Let me see that.

399
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,074
To Polish police and firefighters.

400
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:44,975
Found this craftsman down in Glen Burnie
that you would not believe.

401
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:48,149
- For the nave?
- Yeah, for the nave.

402
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:57,856
We could use another window
on the second floor of the rectory.

403
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:01,564
- The rectory?
- The upstairs hallway.

404
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,294
How much did them dock boys offer
for this spot?

405
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:08,371
- I can match it.
- Offerings are confidential, Stan.

406
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:12,135
- And as you can see--
- I can go as high as $4,000.

407
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,472
Just tell me if they went higher than $4,000.

408
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:19,577
More than $4,000? From the docks?

409
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:22,342
How the hell...

410
00:35:23,587 --> 00:35:25,214
I'm sorry, Father.

411
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:29,520
- Who came to you with the offer?
- Francis Sobotka.

412
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,296
Frank Sobotka has that kind of money?

413
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:34,964
- It was from his local.
- The Checkers?

414
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:39,593
- They don't have 100 guys left paying dues.
- It's a parish of givers, Stan.

415
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:42,672
Maybe you talk to Frank.

416
00:35:43,507 --> 00:35:45,270
Work it out somehow.

417
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:49,011
Yeah, we'll talk.

418
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,684
Major?

419
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:20,203
Well, if it isn't Barnacle Bill, the sailor.

420
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,505
Ray, how you been?

421
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,807
I got nothing but red ink
under my name this year.

422
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:26,644
Landsman's become an asshole with teeth.

423
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:30,285
- Fish your wish, huh?
- Jumper, probably.

424
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:35,323
- This close to the bridge.
- Probably, yeah.

425
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,423
- Pretty, though.
- She is, yeah.

426
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,189
I go into the men's room this morning.

427
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,730
Guess who's in the next stall
puking his guts out.

428
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,231
Bunk Moreland.

429
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,701
- How'd you know?
- Useless fuck can't hold his liquor.

430
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,213
- What's happening, man?
- What's up, Fam?

431
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:06,380
All right.

432
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:10,352
- You ain't heard from Roberto yet?
- Not a goddamn word, man.

433
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:15,364
Billy still got our money though, right?
So you need to get down to New York, man.

434
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:19,002
Fuck kind of game this nigger playing?
You sure of our people?

435
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:21,663
I broke down all their stories
and they came back clean.

436
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,741
Besides, I had some good people
watching them.

437
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:28,602
- Who?
- Tank, Country.

438
00:37:28,712 --> 00:37:30,839
- How long that motherfucker been home?
- A month.

439
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:34,714
Still on parole. He said, "fuck that."
Straight back in the mix.

440
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:35,910
All right.

441
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:40,252
So good, it ain't on us. It's on Roberto.
Set it straight. You know what I mean?

442
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:43,258
So when you go hard on them,
take it light, but be firm.

443
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,022
They got our money
and we ain't got the product.

444
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,724
So, you feel me? The shit ain't right.

445
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,991
How you fixed in here otherwise, B?

446
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,732
This ain't no thing, man.
You know what I mean?

447
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,802
You come in here, man,
you get your mind right.

448
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:03,011
You get in here and you do two days.
It's the day you come in this motherfucker--

449
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:06,549
- And the day you get out this motherfucker.
- That's right.

450
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,013
Exactly.

451
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,253
- What's up?
- How you doing?

452
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:15,587
- Coming from the hiring hall?
- I'm working the Atlantic late today.

453
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,321
- How's it looking for Local 47?
- You're shit out of luck.

454
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,659
ROIROs isn't going to anybody
lower than a G-series.

455
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:23,164
Best you can get,
maybe half a day doing break-bulk...

456
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,064
on an aluminum load at Locust Point.

457
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,797
- Half a day, huh?
- Seniority sucks.

458
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:32,408
- Yeah, if you ain't senior, it does.
- Yeah, you got that right.

459
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,643
- I'm out of here.
- Yeah, I'll see you.

460
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,908
- The fuck you ain't wake me up for?
- Just getting up now, fuck-face?

461
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:40,381
No, actually,
your ma makes a good breakfast.

462
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,975
- No fucking way.
- Bacon and eggs, baby.

463
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,453
You going down to see the Greek, right?

464
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,189
Come on, man.
I ain't gonna fuck it up for you.

465
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,888
For Christ's sake,
will you just get in the car already?

466
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:55,590
Come on. Let's go.

467
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,232
I swear to God, Ziggy.
You open your mouth, I'll fucking kill you.

468
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,761
- Nicky, from the docks.
- Spiros.

469
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,834
How are you? Good?

470
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:35,066
- Who's your friend?
- This is Zig, my uncle's kid.

471
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,333
- Your uncle? Frankie?
- Yeah.

472
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:41,070
Ziggy's his oldest.
My car broke down, you know. He drove.

473
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,805
So you must be the Greek.

474
00:39:48,485 --> 00:39:50,350
Well, I'm Greek anyway.

475
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:55,118
Boris Badanoff.
I know you from around the way, right?

476
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:59,925
Why am I Boris? I don't understand this.
Everywhere I am Boris.

477
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,227
- Shit, you're Russian, right?
- No, Ukraine. Kyiv is Ukraine.

478
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:06,598
- It's the same difference, though.
- No, you're wrong.

479
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:10,601
What's the matter?
You don't like being called Boris?

480
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,765
Sergei.

481
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:16,244
No way, man. Boris is way better.
It's like the guy from the cartoon.

482
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:18,774
Boris and Natasha?

483
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:21,843
Bullwinkle, man. Rocky and Bullwinkle.

484
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:25,248
- You want some coffee, pie?
- No, I'm good.

485
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:28,017
- Actually, what kind of pie you got?
- Hey, Zig.

486
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:30,223
Shut the fuck up, huh?

487
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,800
Malaka.

488
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,377
No, it's cool. He's cool.

489
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,408
- That's Frank's kid?
- Yeah.

490
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,215
He's in the Union, you know.

491
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:56,844
But he's like an L-series,
so he ain't getting any hours.

492
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:08,024
- Same deal, same rate.
- All right. Who's driving?

493
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,227
Again?

494
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,533
You want to mix it up a little more.

495
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,540
Make it so customs doesn't put
no names to faces.

496
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:21,567
You trust a man, you stay with him.

497
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,208
- Okay.
- All right.

498
00:41:27,584 --> 00:41:29,017
Boris it is.

499
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,019
- Sergei.
- Yeah, whatever.

500
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,221
Come on, fucknuts. Let's go.

501
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:37,157
- How's the open-face turkey?
- It's shit. Let's go.

502
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,323
See you guys later.

503
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,858
- Bullwinkle?
- Polacks.

504
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:50,502
You fucking embarrassed me in there, man.

505
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:54,637
You embarrassed yourself, Zig.

506
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,518
You seen my nephew anywhere?

507
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:15,621
Nick? Not yet.
I don't think he got any hours.

508
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:34,276
- Hey, Frank.
- Hey, darling.

509
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:39,079
Just so I can finish my paperwork early,
what are your people gonna steal today?

510
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,451
I don't know.

511
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:44,391
Couple luxury sedans,
some color TVs, wide-screen.

512
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:48,191
Maybe a couple cans of vodka,
maybe a whole container ship.

513
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,731
Okay. Y'all have a good one.

514
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:57,998
You let her fuck with you like that?

515
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,576
She's all right. I like her.

516
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:18,559
I checked the computer.
It's Bay 9, Cell 11. It's right on the bottom.

517
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:22,592
- You working the light, ain't you?
- I'm on it, yeah.

518
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:26,601
- Did they say anything else?
- No. Just that it's the same money to us.

519
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,067
Let's go.

520
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,604
All right, Uncle Frank.

521
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:38,140
- Winona.
- Jimmy, where you been?

522
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,418
Look who it is. Sailor Boy.

523
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,520
- You owe me $10.
- Fuck you.

524
00:43:55,098 --> 00:43:58,295
You told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.
You made it happen, Jay.

525
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:02,498
- I told him where you didn't wanna go.
- Yeah, and they sent me there.

526
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:05,200
I knew Rawls was pissed,
I didn't know how pissed.

527
00:44:05,308 --> 00:44:07,037
What can I tell you?

528
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:12,076
- Where's Bunk?
- Out on a call with Crutchfield.

529
00:44:13,683 --> 00:44:16,243
What's up with the girl?
She come off the bridge or what?

530
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:19,914
Doc Frazier posted her today.
Blunt-force trauma to the head and chest.

531
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:22,048
He says she's dead
before she hits the water.

532
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,354
What about the defense wounds?

533
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:27,889
Bruising on three fingers?
We saw that as soon as we picked her up.

534
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,727
You missed the defense wounds?

535
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,267
I wasn't looking.
Thought she went off the bridge.

536
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,530
Also, she's in the drink
with no coat or shoes.

537
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:37,106
Maybe that stuff comes off in the water,
maybe not.

538
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:40,404
I don't see her going to the bridge in winter
dressed like she was.

539
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,478
But then that's just me.

540
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,236
Tell Bunk I was here, will you?

541
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:45,575
Have fun.

542
00:44:45,682 --> 00:44:49,209
We already had our fun.
Dumping her on Baltimore County.

543
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:52,888
On the County?

544
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:57,650
You fished her out east of the bridge.
That's Baltimore County. She's their stat.

545
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:00,821
- You sold them on that?
- Rawls did.

546
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,261
He called up the Colonel and said:

547
00:45:03,366 --> 00:45:06,164
"You got one hell of a murder
on your hands."

548
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,467
It's all about self-preservation, Jimmy.

549
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:13,475
Something you never learned.

550
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,344
Hey, Norris. State Police, Line 2.

551
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,808
A little to the right!

552
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,449
Good, bring her down!

553
00:45:55,952 --> 00:45:58,045
It's there whenever they want it.

554
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:09,561
Now that you are my client, Mr. Bell...

555
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,430
we are protected
by the attorney-client privilege.

556
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:15,528
- I thought Roberto would be here.
- Not likely.

557
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:18,536
This, I'm afraid, was in Monday's papers.

558
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:25,242
It seems Roberto Castellano y Silva
has been targeted by the DEA.

559
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:28,180
That's why we didn't do the business?

560
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:32,688
Right now, Roberto and his people aren't
going to be getting involved in anything...

561
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,019
that could further complicate the situation.

562
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,492
You know, usually, when you take a fall,
you get right back in there...

563
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:41,792
- 'cause you know nobody's watching, right?
- Sometimes.

564
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:45,662
And sometimes you wonder
how it is you got caught in the first place.

565
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,329
And you decide to change the pattern.

566
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:49,998
He took our money?

567
00:46:50,106 --> 00:46:53,132
Your advance payment arrived
as our problem did.

568
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:56,178
And I'm told the money
is on the way back to Baltimore.

569
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:58,747
You know, I get the feeling
that you're blaming us...

570
00:46:58,848 --> 00:47:01,373
for Roberto's predicament.

571
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:05,678
Perhaps your problems in Baltimore
and my client's problems here...

572
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,313
are coincidental.

573
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:09,358
- But right now--
- Listen to me.

574
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,652
He was the first to know that we took a hit.

575
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:13,991
He knows no one came close
to rolling over us...

576
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,429
and all the documents from the case.

577
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:21,101
Nonetheless, we have a legitimate concern.

578
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:26,140
Considering the scope
of Mr. Barksdale's operation...

579
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:29,872
his sentence was, to say the least, mild.

580
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:34,541
But if the possibility exists,
however unlikely...

581
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:39,350
that the leniency he received
was the result of cooperation...

582
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:44,590
You understand our position, I'm sure.

583
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:53,601
Frank, it's sitting out there waiting...

584
00:47:53,703 --> 00:47:55,830
and this Russian fuck
won't take it off the pier.

585
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:56,928
I ain't blind.

586
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,201
I don't like it
sitting out in the open that long.

587
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,834
The customs seal is broke.
Somebody's gonna see it.

588
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,175
Our asses are hanging out here.

589
00:48:15,091 --> 00:48:17,582
- Yeah?
- Nicky, what the fuck? It's still here.

590
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:19,218
- Shit.
- Yeah.

591
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,889
- Where's Sergei?
- He's parked at the end of the lot.

592
00:48:21,998 --> 00:48:24,558
- What's he waiting for?
- I got no fucking idea.

593
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,762
But the ship's almost empty.
They need to shit or get off the pot.

594
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,839
- I'll look into it.
- Yeah.

595
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:33,704
Okay, I understand.

596
00:48:55,131 --> 00:48:59,067
Fuck it. Get it on a fifth wheel
and lose it in the stack. We're at risk.

597
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:12,873
I ain't lying when I say
this paperwork is kicking my ass.

598
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,968
Maybe so. But the end of the day,
you come through the door in one piece.

599
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,877
You like to think so.

600
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,685
But all these paper cuts
are starting to take their toll.

601
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,447
You big, nasty detective. Come here.

602
00:50:28,057 --> 00:50:30,787
Let me give your little boo-boo a kiss.

603
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:44,033
- All this?
- I'm just getting started.

604
00:50:44,874 --> 00:50:46,569
$1000 for the doctor.

605
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:50,578
$1000 each time, girlfriend.
Every month till I'm pregnant.

606
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,379
There's gotta be a better way.

607
00:50:54,717 --> 00:50:56,776
That would be on you, sweetheart.

608
00:50:56,886 --> 00:51:00,117
Come up with a suitable donor
and we pay a lot less.

609
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,021
Not with your pussy
would I fuck anyone of these guys.

610
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:07,358
What did you just say?
No, you didn't just say that.

611
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,993
Sergeant.

612
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,298
Your floater's come back.

613
00:51:43,566 --> 00:51:46,160
County boys are putting her
on our side of the bridge.

614
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,134
- No fucking way.
- Yeah.

615
00:51:48,571 --> 00:51:51,335
Some useless fuck in our Marine Unit
faxed them a report...

616
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,966
on the early morning tides
and wind currents.

617
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:57,544
Shows the body went in the water
west of the bridge and drifted out.

618
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,205
McNulty.

619
00:52:01,217 --> 00:52:04,380
Fucking Jimmy.
Fucking with us for the fun of it.

620
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:08,757
I gotta give the son of a bitch
some credit for wit on this one.

621
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:13,526
- Cocksucker.
- Motherfucker.

622
00:52:30,813 --> 00:52:32,872
The count is right. What's on the shelf?

623
00:52:32,982 --> 00:52:36,850
Mace carrying 10 down here.
So, Moe Man holding about 38 up top.

624
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:39,888
I checked the stash, and we way low.

625
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:41,980
- Moe Man taking our shit.
- What he holding?

626
00:52:42,091 --> 00:52:45,185
He say he holds about 30-something,
but I know that ain't right.

627
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:46,728
I'm gonna fuck him up.

628
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:48,990
First thing you think to do
is fuck a nigger up.

629
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:51,760
When your brick brain gonna realize
there's more to this...

630
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,961
than just thumpin' on niggers?

631
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,096
- What Moe supposed to be holding?
- 38, thereabout.

632
00:52:57,206 --> 00:53:00,004
- Ain't you the damn fool?
- But then we low.

633
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:03,111
Look, nigger, if we low,
it 'cause String want us that way.

634
00:53:03,212 --> 00:53:06,978
When he wants us up, we be up.
String is on top of the shit.

635
00:53:07,383 --> 00:53:09,317
He on top of everything.

636
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,111
Go back to your spot, man.

637
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,924
Fucking McNulty.

638
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,700
The Prince of Tides.

639
00:55:40,803 --> 00:55:42,896
- Brother, you feeling strong today?
- Yeah.

640
00:55:43,005 --> 00:55:45,599
See if you can get his ass out of that chair.

641
00:55:47,443 --> 00:55:50,241
He said it was fine
if you wanted to hit him, too.

642
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,208
What's the first thing a guy from Local 47
does after he gets laid?

643
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:57,218
- What?
- Wipes the pepper spray from his eyes.

644
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:01,454
Hey, Frank. Something's going on.

645
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:55,103
- It's fucking girls, man. Young ones.
- There's a dozen of them.

646
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:56,906
Dead? They're dead?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
