1
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:35,150
You need another bag?

2
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:36,909
Yo, Mike, where you at?

3
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:38,258
Yeah, over here.

4
00:01:39,336 --> 00:01:39,985
Drug war?

5
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:46,870
Barksdals coming back
on my boy Marlo, hmm?

6
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:49,427
Shit.

7
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:50,928
Got it.

8
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:00,733
Yo man, I don't know where we at.

9
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:03,724
We are in Baltimore, Lamar.

10
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,812
Baltimore, Maryland.

11
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,960
That's the second crib of mine
them motherfuckers cracked this week.

12
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,110
Stir up a hornet's nest

13
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,300
no tellin' who gonna get stung.

14
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:32,389
All paranoid an' shit.

15
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:33,953
Got to be.

16
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:52,295
They got Latroy.

17
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:57,724
What the fuck is y'all
on the streets for, man?

18
00:03:57,747 --> 00:04:00,140
Don't you all know there's
a fucking war going on, man?

19
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:01,536
Get the fuck in the truck, man.

20
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,570
What happened to all them towers?

21
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:37,658
Slow train comin'.

22
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:43,159
Reform, Lamar.

23
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:45,317
Reform.

24
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,187
Reformation

25
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,637
We should be up on
this shit, hearin' voices.

26
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,382
We get a signature number
on Bodie's phone, we will be.

27
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:48,236
We got enough P.C.
off the burners alone.

28
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:51,203
Every time these fucking pen
registers click out a call

29
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:52,490
it screams drug conspiracy.

30
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,390
I'm not the one
takin' the case to court.

31
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:57,240
Pearlman wants a specific link
to a known drug trafficker.

32
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:05,313
These drug crews?

33
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:07,718
They're dumping phones
every couple weeks at best.

34
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:10,251
So when we do get a wire up,
it's gonna be a limited run.

35
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:13,004
And dumping phones doesn't
meet the cellular company's

36
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,047
definition of exigent
circumstance, huh?

37
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:17,860
What's your boss willing to do?

38
00:07:18,377 --> 00:07:18,916
Demper?

39
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:22,175
He's a bit too focused on next
year's re-election fight.

40
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:23,201
How about the feds?

41
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:25,401
They say they can't
do anything for us

42
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:28,275
and if you look at how they use
the federal communications act

43
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:29,108
they're not lying.

44
00:07:29,507 --> 00:07:31,793
For national security stuff,
they use the Patriot Act

45
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:33,365
every thing else gets shorted.

46
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:36,368
The fact is, the industry
has all of us by the balls.

47
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:41,013
Pardon my french, Your Honor.

48
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,181
Alright, I'll tell you what.

49
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:45,752
Best I can do for you is this:

50
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:49,588
You give me a boilerplate affidavit
with the P.C. from the court report

51
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,307
and then as you get fresh
numbers for new disposables

52
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:54,041
you call me...

53
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:58,193
anytime, day or night,
to jump phones.

54
00:07:58,581 --> 00:07:59,472
That helps.

55
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,384
But we're still gonna be getting up

56
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:03,284
on their phones even
as they're coming down.

57
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:04,066
Yeah, probably so.

58
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,178
- This is so totally...
- fucked up?

59
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:15,809
"Je parle français bien,
et tu es très charmant aujourd'hui. "

60
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:23,011
Judge Phelan has you on his mind.

61
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,501
How long has that been going on?

62
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:27,014
Started with...

63
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:30,228
my first jury trial
in his court, I think.

64
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,046
I bet you won all your motions.

65
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:39,043
You wanted to see me, sir?

66
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,251
Have a seat.

67
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:46,849
I wanna thank you for
the loyalty you showed

68
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:48,503
moving that body.

69
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,303
It wasn't the most
sensible thing, but...

70
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,755
I appreciate it nonetheless.

71
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:56,400
You're a good man, Sergeant

72
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,389
you got good instincts

73
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,404
and as far as I can tell
you're a decent supervisor.

74
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,149
But from where I sit

75
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,553
you ain't shit when
it come to policin'.

76
00:09:08,538 --> 00:09:10,650
Don't take it personal,
ain't just you.

77
00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:12,574
It's all our young police.

78
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:14,533
A whole generation of y'all.

79
00:09:15,565 --> 00:09:16,667
Now, you think about it:

80
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,550
You been here over
a year now, Carver.

81
00:09:20,586 --> 00:09:22,521
You got nobody looking out for you

82
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:24,163
nobody willing to talk to you.

83
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:26,685
That about sum it up?

84
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:29,335
And that's a problem.

85
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:31,939
And I didn't think
there was anyway

86
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,628
I was ever gonna
get my head around it.

87
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,739
But then Dozerman
gets shot for some bullshit...

88
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:39,842
and that's when
I 'bout reach my limit.

89
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:42,962
And that's when the idea
of the free zone

90
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:44,088
of Hamsterdam come to me.

91
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:47,173
Because this drug thing,
this ain't police work.

92
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:48,991
No, it ain't.

93
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,237
I mean, I can send any fool
with a badge and a gun

94
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:55,677
up on those corners and
jack a crew and grab vials.

95
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:57,448
But policing?

96
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:02,504
You call something a war,
and pretty soon

97
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:05,020
everybody gonna running
around acting like warriors.

98
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:08,516
They gonna be runnin'
around on a damn crusade

99
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,305
stormin' corners, slappin' on
cuffs, rackin' up body counts.

100
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:15,352
And when you at war,
you need a fuckin' enemy.

101
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,311
And pretty soon

102
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:20,644
damn near everybody on every
corner is your fuckin' enemy

103
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:24,192
and soon the neighborhood that
you're supposed to be policin'

104
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,875
that's just occupied territory.

105
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:29,277
You follow this?

106
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:30,908
I think so.

107
00:10:31,604 --> 00:10:33,868
Look, the point I'm makin',
Carver, is this...

108
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:36,942
soldierin' and policin',
they ain't the same thing.

109
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,627
And before we went
and took the wrong turn

110
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:41,528
and started with these war games

111
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,241
the cop walked a beat,
and he learned that post.

112
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,441
And if there were things
that happened up on that post

113
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:51,669
whether there be a rape,
a robbery, a shooting...

114
00:10:52,502 --> 00:10:55,071
he had people out there helping
him, feeding him information.

115
00:10:56,598 --> 00:10:59,577
But every time I come to you,
my D.E.U. sergeant

116
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:01,102
for information

117
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,963
to find out what's going
on out there on them streets

118
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:06,978
all that came back
was some bullshit.

119
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,601
You had your stats, you had
your arrests, you had your seizures.

120
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:14,745
But don't none of that amount
to shit when you talking about

121
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,897
protecting a neighborhood
now, do it?

122
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:25,640
You know the worst
thing about this

123
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:28,265
so called drug war?

124
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:29,825
To my mind?

125
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,393
It just ruined this job.

126
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:39,893
Major?

127
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:41,004
What do you got?

128
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:41,833
Incoming.

129
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,676
"Sunpapers" reporter.

130
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:45,805
Been to the free zones,
all three of 'em.

131
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,139
It's begun.

132
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:56,545
I was thinkin', maybe
we rewrite the affidavit

133
00:11:56,557 --> 00:11:59,005
add some of the stuff we're
gettin' from the pen registers

134
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:00,967
build the case that way,
take it to the judge.

135
00:12:00,991 --> 00:12:02,007
You have a law degree?

136
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:04,041
If you did, it would
be your call to make.

137
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,228
Who would pretend to be
a lawyer that wasn't?

138
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,215
I'm just saying.

139
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:10,012
I think we're being
too cautious on this.

140
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:11,702
We're going the
extra mile for Phelan.

141
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:14,161
A short cut now could cost us
later in motions hearings.

142
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,894
We drew Phelan on this wiretap?

143
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:18,365
That two-faced hack sold
me out the last go-round.

144
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,030
Relax...

145
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,940
he's not running for
a new term. He'll be fine.

146
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,130
He's a piece of shit.

147
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:25,358
We're all pieces of shit
when we're in your way.

148
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:27,521
That goes with the territory.

149
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:39,246
Point taken.

150
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:43,738
So it's these warehouses

151
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:47,220
the old Winchester homes and the
dead blocks down by Vincent Street.

152
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:48,260
All three.

153
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,526
And they're just supposed
to let it go on like this?

154
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:54,266
Colvin told us to push the
street dealing in these areas

155
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:56,352
then we would start
locking people up.

156
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:58,456
But so far, not a single
fucking arrest.

157
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,241
And they know about this downtown?

158
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:02,310
I don't think they have
a fucking clue about it.

159
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:04,533
But I'd love to be there
when you pop the question.

160
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:08,258
This is just...

161
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,256
Tell me about it.

162
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:20,735
Got the place lookin' good.

163
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:21,420
Yeah.

164
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:24,754
Now all needs doin' is to go
out and get you some kids.

165
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:25,849
Come on, man.

166
00:13:26,571 --> 00:13:27,753
You makin' it sound easy

167
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:30,117
but to tell you the truth

168
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,451
I ain't got no idea how
to go at these hoppers.

169
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:35,414
I wouldn't lose
any sleep over that.

170
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:37,532
Nobody else does neither.

171
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:47,061
We got one.

172
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:49,003
His grandmother...

173
00:13:49,298 --> 00:13:50,031
<i>Looking for me?</i>

174
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:52,904
<i>Look, boy, there's no reason
to leave your clothes in the washer. </i>

175
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:55,091
<i>How many damn times
do I have to tell you... </i>

176
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:57,681
<i>Gag, grandma, sorry,
I just forgot, okay?</i>

177
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,367
<i>But I did pick up the laundry
soap, I picked it up... </i>

178
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,022
Laundry soap,
that's definitely code.

179
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:04,717
Now, let's listen to an intercept
we made of Bodie Broadus

180
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,259
when we were up on the pay
phones a couple years back.

181
00:14:08,393 --> 00:14:09,270
<i>I'm tellin' ya all</i>

182
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:11,668
<i>I saw the boy he sayin'
he ain't got that thing. </i>

183
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,335
Same voice, no question.

184
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,623
I'll let the judge know.

185
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:17,414
Reference the voice comparison
in the court report.

186
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:18,667
We're up.

187
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,658
Major Colvin, Western district.

188
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,753
Banisky, "Sunpapers".

189
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,491
So this your idea?

190
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:36,930
Mind if we walk?

191
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,454
You got dealers
selling with impunity.

192
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,102
Addicts shooting up on the street.

193
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,661
People down here doing outreach,
giving out needles and all.

194
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:53,403
I mean, who knows about
this down at headquarters?

195
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:55,472
Command is well
aware of the situation

196
00:14:56,253 --> 00:14:58,925
and while there were
some initial concern

197
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:01,153
but they feel the cases
that we're gonna bring in...

198
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:01,709
Cases?

199
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:03,565
Yeah, prosecutions, sure.

200
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:06,663
Your officers say no one's being
locked up in the free zones.

201
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:08,949
My troops are only involved
in pushing the trafficking

202
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:09,961
to designated areas.

203
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,622
I mean they're completely ignorant
of the investigative aspect

204
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:14,070
that's run out of C.I.D. downtown.

205
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:14,661
Yeah?

206
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:16,198
Who's the lead detective?

207
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:18,030
Look...

208
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,319
I already said more than I should.

209
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:24,688
Bottom line is you start
throwing calls around right now

210
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:27,750
they gonna shit blue
thinking there's a leak.

211
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,583
They gonna come up
on the case early

212
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:31,894
and we're not gonna get all
we can out of the good work

213
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:32,638
we did down here.

214
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:35,322
You're telling me all this
is an enforcement strategy.

215
00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:38,621
What the hell else could it be?

216
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,555
I mean, you think we'd actually
let this happen otherwise?

217
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:44,163
Come on, Banisky.

218
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,433
I mean, look, look at this mess.

219
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,767
Any other reporter gets on it...

220
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:54,309
I give it to you and you
run with it right then.

221
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,633
Absolutely.

222
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:57,891
A week.

223
00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:00,150
But then I gotta run
something no matter what.

224
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:02,851
<i>Purple Rain, Purple Rain. </i>

225
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:03,643
It's understood.

226
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:09,413
So, Brother, what
brought you back?

227
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:13,084
It disturbs me to leave
business unfinished.

228
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:16,868
Heard you was shot before
you even got started down here.

229
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,972
Not like you to get played.

230
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:20,734
Betrayed, you mean.

231
00:16:21,467 --> 00:16:23,193
I am looking for the man they sent.

232
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,512
From his accent he's homegrown,
raised on the street.

233
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:30,000
Skilled, intelligent.
Late 20s, dark

234
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:33,866
but with a scar
across his face like so.

235
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:36,968
You down with this nigger?

236
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:38,008
I know him.

237
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:39,498
Not to speak to

238
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:42,335
but you can't be
anywhere near the game

239
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,695
and not know
the motherfucker.

240
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,853
He with Barksdale?

241
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,555
He with himself.

242
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:51,007
'Cept for when he runnin'
with a young boy or two...

243
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:55,216
10 months to the primary,
and you right now

244
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:56,310
should be all about money.

245
00:16:56,322 --> 00:16:58,603
I know, I know,
dialing for dollars.

246
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:01,500
You start this week and you don't
stop until you hit your numbers.

247
00:17:01,807 --> 00:17:03,864
We're gonna need a million
just for television.

248
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:05,307
You really think this is doable?

249
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:07,606
The odds aren't great, but yeah...

250
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,249
I think it can be done.

251
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:12,406
As long as the thousand things
that can go wrong don't go wrong.

252
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:13,470
Even for a white guy?

253
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:15,208
Even for a white guy.

254
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:17,081
Speaking of which

255
00:17:17,555 --> 00:17:20,801
I notice a certain
monochromatic effect here.

256
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:23,868
One thing we're gonna
need is black faces

257
00:17:24,495 --> 00:17:26,688
and we're gonna need them
in prominent positions.

258
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,362
You're right.

259
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:30,329
We've gotta start thinking about
endorsements by black leaders.

260
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,096
Ministers, community people,
elected officials.

261
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:34,899
Here comes the hard part:

262
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:38,304
Splitting the black vote is the
only way to make the math work.

263
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:40,858
So Tony Gray's gotta
get in the race

264
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,766
he's gotta stay in the race and
he's gotta stay viable in the race.

265
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:45,565
Guy's kind of a lightweight,
ain't he?

266
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:46,924
He's a good guy, all in all.

267
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,757
Great, he's a good guy

268
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:51,440
but we need him to siphon
votes from Royce.

269
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:52,138
I dunno.

270
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:53,994
This thing with Tony...

271
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:56,262
it's not personal, Tommy.

272
00:17:56,629 --> 00:17:57,622
It's politics.

273
00:17:58,934 --> 00:17:59,963
Live with it or lose.

274
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:04,916
<i>Hey, yo. </i>

275
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:07,323
<i>That boy with the sharp nose,
he gonna, you know... </i>

276
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:08,363
<i>he going to the Apollo. </i>

277
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,179
<i>The Apollo?</i>

278
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:11,059
<i>Yeah, he gonna need two tickets. </i>

279
00:18:11,248 --> 00:18:13,187
<i>Damn, Tweety Bird
workin' that shit. </i>

280
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:16,107
<i>Motherfucker, how many times
I gotta tell you not to use no names?</i>

281
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:18,152
<i>Oh yeah, right.
So I holler at you?</i>

282
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:19,453
<i>Yeah, a-ight. </i>

283
00:18:21,238 --> 00:18:22,621
Apollo, like the theater?

284
00:18:22,657 --> 00:18:24,016
Like 125th Street.

285
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,700
125 grams, one eighth of a kilo.

286
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:28,268
Two tickets means twice that.

287
00:18:28,303 --> 00:18:30,159
Only new code so
far is Hamsterdam.

288
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,247
Hamsterdam?

289
00:18:31,354 --> 00:18:34,226
We're thinkin' it might have
something to do with the stash house.

290
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,513
Well, I'm gonna hook up with Kima,
cash the Tweety Bird meet.

291
00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:41,183
You're happy with
what we're getting?

292
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:44,399
Another week of calls like this
and we'll have their network

293
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:46,681
fleshed out and plenty
more phones to go up on.

294
00:18:48,686 --> 00:18:50,282
I need a moment with the detectives.

295
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:52,174
Sure.

296
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,535
I.I.D. picked up Prez's shooting.

297
00:18:58,641 --> 00:18:59,522
It's to be expected.

298
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,146
The racial thing alone is tense
enough that they gotta react.

299
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:03,825
No luck at all to that boy, huh?

300
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:07,065
For the supervisor's report

301
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:09,364
I need to ask if either of you

302
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:11,882
had any indication that Prez
harbored racial prejudices.

303
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,181
Well, he harbored
some weird shit, no doubt.

304
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:16,801
But I never got a racial vibe.

305
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,574
Lieutenant, you seriously askin'?

306
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:27,660
Not to start no shit

307
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:29,848
but you think Waggoner
gets shot if he's white?

308
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,472
Description called
for a number one male.

309
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:33,631
I'm just sayin'.

310
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:40,535
The good lord set sunday
mornin' aside for church-goin'.

311
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:43,770
Even kenny bird and peanut,
when they was warring,

312
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,862
had the good sense
to respect the truce.

313
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:48,593
You know them
Barksdales sent a hat?

314
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:51,561
A church crown?

315
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:54,891
Walked up, rang the bell,
and set it down on her porch.

316
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:56,286
'Cause they shamed.

317
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:00,684
Is Miss Josephine mendin'?

318
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:02,688
She bruised up still,
but she a-ight though.

319
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:04,662
But you ain't.

320
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:07,071
Not until I settle this for good.

321
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:16,009
Hey, yo, Butch, I want you
to go inside my bank

322
00:20:16,588 --> 00:20:17,421
and spread the word:

323
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:20,022
Omar payin' cash money to get
at them people, ya feel me?

324
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:21,323
Save your money.

325
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:23,238
Come now, Butch,
I got to do this, yo.

326
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,669
I'm sayin' you ain't got to pay.

327
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:29,582
Thomkins, up on McCulloh.

328
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,176
What the funeral home?

329
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:39,437
You mean to tell me, all this time,
you had a scope on them clowns

330
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,139
and you ain't let loose
a mumblin' word.

331
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:42,700
Caught myself lookin' out for you.

332
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:46,080
Fact of the matter is,
your chances of goin' up

333
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:49,480
against that mob and comin'
back is as slim as a garter snake.

334
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,750
I can't help that now, Butch.

335
00:21:02,448 --> 00:21:03,856
The fuck?
Where's my people?

336
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:05,439
Slim Charles pulled 'em.

337
00:21:05,838 --> 00:21:06,671
Hired new muscle.

338
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,759
Slim Charles?
When the fuck did he...

339
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,944
How's the count?

340
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,419
Down bad for the
third straight week.

341
00:21:14,818 --> 00:21:16,531
And the shelf-life
of the shit we got

342
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:17,903
it ain't gonna last, String.

343
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:25,999
I know.

344
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:28,626
Slim said they was to stick
to you for protection.

345
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:35,990
Nice shot.

346
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:38,289
Dribble it back out.
Dribble it back out.

347
00:21:38,734 --> 00:21:39,685
Get your dribble on.

348
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,086
Hey, yo, easy, easy.

349
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:45,099
Y'all just hacking my man up.

350
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,389
Foul machine.

351
00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:50,213
Nice drive.

352
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,955
Kinda unschooled, ain't they?

353
00:21:58,101 --> 00:22:00,635
Is that observation meant as
just a casual curbside fuck-you

354
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,923
or are you lookin' to step up,
maybe help out here?

355
00:22:04,318 --> 00:22:05,386
I'ma give it a try.

356
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,531
I'm lookin' to get some
kids interested in boxin'.

357
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:10,959
Boxing?

358
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:14,349
Look here.

359
00:22:15,393 --> 00:22:16,672
This is my time-out corner.

360
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:19,824
Where I send children
who can't play nice together.

361
00:22:21,102 --> 00:22:23,941
Listen up, this man's
starting a boxing program.

362
00:22:23,964 --> 00:22:26,897
And from the looks of some of you,
signing on might be a good thing.

363
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:27,877
Gonna need it.

364
00:22:28,135 --> 00:22:30,011
Only thing he know
how to do with his fist

365
00:22:30,023 --> 00:22:31,278
is wrap it around his cock.

366
00:22:31,736 --> 00:22:32,533
Fuck you, man.

367
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,601
I'm gonna kick your ass.

368
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:35,314
Come on, motherfucker,
you ain't shit.

369
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:39,369
Yo, sit down, sit down,
come on, ease up.

370
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,501
Sit down, sit down, come on,
man, sit down, man, sit down.

371
00:22:44,037 --> 00:22:44,765
My man...

372
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:52,705
my man, you droppin' your right.

373
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:56,295
You see, if the youngun there
was trained, he'd whip you.

374
00:22:56,412 --> 00:22:57,961
Look like he was the one got beat.

375
00:23:00,489 --> 00:23:02,072
Stand up, let me
show you something.

376
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:05,697
Come on, man.
I ain't gonna hurt you.

377
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:09,809
<i>Yellow Tops, Yellow Tops,
got them Yellow Tops. </i>

378
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:11,379
<i>Yellow tops. </i>

379
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:13,432
See that?

380
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:15,790
Alright, sit down.

381
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,711
Look, if y'all want to learn more

382
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:23,117
I got a gym down on Gilmor
in the old tire plant.

383
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:24,900
You're all welcome.

384
00:23:25,897 --> 00:23:26,519
Alright?

385
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:44,094
I saw Tweety Bird parked up there.

386
00:23:45,255 --> 00:23:47,167
Now all we got to do
is wait for the re-up.

387
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:50,733
I hope these fucks don't dick 'round
and make us sit here all day.

388
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:53,196
What, this eatin' at you?

389
00:23:55,483 --> 00:23:56,327
No, I'm good.

390
00:23:58,427 --> 00:23:59,600
Yeah, I can see that.

391
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,358
Remember that woman
I was talking about?

392
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,352
The politician woman?

393
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:08,900
How's it going?

394
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:10,742
It ain't, it turned to shit.

395
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:18,600
Feel like I don't even belong to any
world that even fucking matters.

396
00:24:19,562 --> 00:24:20,477
'Cause you're a cop?

397
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:22,787
Naw, it's not just that.

398
00:24:25,478 --> 00:24:26,944
It's like, I went to meet her once.

399
00:24:26,956 --> 00:24:28,763
She was in a hotel
room, the top floor.

400
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,606
I punch the button on the elevator,
it doesn't even go there

401
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:33,715
because you have to have
some fucking special key

402
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:35,627
to even get to that
special fucking floor.

403
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:40,061
So I go to the front desk, some
sneering fuck call upstairs

404
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,032
gimme permission to go get laid.

405
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,376
I listen to the shit she talks about

406
00:24:46,377 --> 00:24:49,309
and for the first time in my life,
I feel like a fucking doormat.

407
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:51,323
Like anyone with
any smarts would

408
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,161
do something else with
his life, you know?

409
00:24:54,537 --> 00:24:55,557
Earn money or...

410
00:24:56,894 --> 00:24:57,598
get elected.

411
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:01,754
Like I'm just a breathin'
machine for my fucking dick.

412
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:05,743
I'm serious.

413
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:09,074
I'm the smartest asshole
in three districts

414
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:11,033
and she looks at me like
I'm some stupid fuck

415
00:25:11,056 --> 00:25:14,249
playing some stupid game
for stupid penny-ante stakes.

416
00:25:17,498 --> 00:25:19,117
She fuckin' looks through me, Kima.

417
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:32,046
Stay in the car, man.

418
00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:34,031
But the tall man said
to stick to you like...

419
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:36,670
Tall man gonna be there when
I'm stomp on your fucking head?

420
00:25:37,489 --> 00:25:38,170
Stay in the car.

421
00:25:50,288 --> 00:25:52,798
Yo, make it short, man,
I got a meet to make.

422
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:54,124
Oh, fuck the meet!

423
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,080
You harder to get at than
my fat wife's cunt, nigger.

424
00:25:57,303 --> 00:25:58,906
Yeah, you high and
mighty Barksdales

425
00:25:58,907 --> 00:26:00,817
can afford to sit back
and play low key,

426
00:26:01,408 --> 00:26:03,430
But some of us gotta work
for a got-damn livin'.

427
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:05,822
What you think this mess
ain't fuckin' up our business?

428
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:08,251
That mean Avon's willin' to sit
down and talk with Marlo

429
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:09,142
work this shit out?

430
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,304
Well, if that don't happen,
String, I got you some bad news.

431
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:18,579
Me and the boys had us a sit down.

432
00:26:18,884 --> 00:26:20,855
Got a quorum an'
took a vote that says...

433
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:24,335
if y'all don't quit this war
we of a mind to shut you out.

434
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:27,068
And when I say out, String,
I mean out the package.

435
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,472
The boys don't want
to extend the good shit

436
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:32,370
if it's gonna keep you and your
peoples out on them corners bangin'.

437
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:34,258
What about the boy?
What the fuck he say?

438
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:35,877
Vinson say Marlo willing to talk

439
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:38,000
if he can keep his corners.

440
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:42,704
Now, hear me on this,
String, we ain't no ingrates.

441
00:26:43,091 --> 00:26:45,648
We all recognize your
contribute to the co-op.

442
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,573
But the feeling is this:

443
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:50,541
it ain't right for you to be
at the head of our table

444
00:26:50,564 --> 00:26:52,019
when you can't call off your dog.

445
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,617
Call it a crisis of leadership.

446
00:27:03,138 --> 00:27:04,147
You're gonna tell 'em?

447
00:27:05,531 --> 00:27:06,059
Got to.

448
00:27:06,856 --> 00:27:08,806
Between the health care
workers, the reporter

449
00:27:08,892 --> 00:27:11,133
my own pissed-off troops,
it's gonna come out.

450
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:14,335
Either tomorrow, or the next day.

451
00:27:14,804 --> 00:27:16,177
Then we should make a few arrests

452
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:17,866
make it look tactical.

453
00:27:18,312 --> 00:27:19,009
Naw.

454
00:27:20,428 --> 00:27:23,373
You know what happens if we start
lockin' people up in Hamsterdam?

455
00:27:24,522 --> 00:27:27,173
The whole rest of the district
goes back to being a shithole.

456
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:29,443
Naw.

457
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,704
If Rawls is gonna hand me my ass

458
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,774
at least give me a chance
to tell the man my story first.

459
00:27:52,446 --> 00:27:53,021
Devonne.

460
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,101
It needed doin'.

461
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:13,778
<i>Somebody just got shot. </i>

462
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:21,251
What you want I should give the
snitch that clued us to the denali.

463
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:24,092
I mean we didn't
get Marlo, but still...

464
00:28:24,526 --> 00:28:26,297
No, he kept his end up.

465
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:27,024
Go it all.

466
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:29,711
Avon, I need a word, man.

467
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,540
A- ight, get them
things out of here.

468
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:35,144
Check it out, String.

469
00:28:35,707 --> 00:28:38,041
This shit got a kill range
of like 50 meters.

470
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,666
Slim got this from some soldier
comin' back from wherever.

471
00:28:46,721 --> 00:28:48,140
I spoke to Prop Joe's people.

472
00:28:49,677 --> 00:28:51,085
They think we can work this out.

473
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:52,199
A sit-down?

474
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:54,346
It's the perfect time
for it, man, I mean...

475
00:28:55,308 --> 00:28:56,871
you done represented yourself, man.

476
00:28:56,895 --> 00:28:58,584
Your name ringin' out
now that you done

477
00:28:58,596 --> 00:29:00,202
taken Marlo down
a notch or two, man.

478
00:29:00,203 --> 00:29:01,552
So why not quit while we ahead.

479
00:29:02,103 --> 00:29:03,719
Just let me get this
thing right, man

480
00:29:03,738 --> 00:29:05,839
then, you know, we get
back to business as usual.

481
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:07,116
They gonna cut us out, Avon!

482
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:09,382
Prop Joe and them niggers,
man, they took a vote.

483
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:10,326
They gonna cut us out.

484
00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:12,707
We ain't gonna have that dope,
so even if we win, we lose

485
00:29:12,731 --> 00:29:15,839
'cause we ain't gonna have no product
to put on those fucking corners, B.

486
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:16,696
Avon, look at you.

487
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:19,811
Fuckin' shooting dope without
a fucking needle right now, man

488
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:22,637
getting high on a power trip,
playin' fucking soldier.

489
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:25,664
Yo, you gotta sit back, man,
think about our business.

490
00:29:25,687 --> 00:29:26,731
What the fuck you want?

491
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,463
That motherfucker, he good.

492
00:29:37,823 --> 00:29:38,539
What happened?

493
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:46,925
You know, Avon, you gotta think about
why we got in this game for, man.

494
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:49,012
Was it the rep?

495
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,671
Was it so our names could ring out

496
00:29:51,695 --> 00:29:53,650
on some fucking ghetto
street corners, man?

497
00:29:53,677 --> 00:29:56,269
Naw, man, there's games
beyond the fucking game.

498
00:29:57,895 --> 00:30:00,827
Avon, look, you and me,
we brothers, B.

499
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:03,390
We ain't think we make it
this fucking far, but fuck

500
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:04,562
if we ain't standing here

501
00:30:04,563 --> 00:30:06,470
right now, with the
whole world at our feet.

502
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,507
The whole world, man,
not these fucking corners.

503
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:11,102
The whole world, B.

504
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,081
You know what Slim just told me?

505
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:17,753
Devonne come up dead.

506
00:30:20,857 --> 00:30:22,945
She was shot one in the
mouth, one in each tit.

507
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:28,329
You still want to
talk truce, String?

508
00:30:31,803 --> 00:30:34,137
You right when you say I need
to learn more discipline.

509
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:35,298
But this...

510
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,984
you could do this better...

511
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:39,932
You're the perfect bait, Lamar.

512
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,662
They'll see you as conflicted.

513
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,938
Your homophobia is so visceral.

514
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:45,697
You see that?

515
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:47,855
I ain't even stepped
inside the joint yet

516
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,697
and you callin' me
a cocksucker already.

517
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:19,537
You in the right place?

518
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:22,833
I'm lookin' for someone name Omar.

519
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:26,267
No last name.
Scar across his face an' shit.

520
00:31:26,748 --> 00:31:27,839
Scarface named Omar.

521
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,595
Sounds different,
but I can't help you.

522
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:31,463
You drinking?

523
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:40,002
Maybe you wait four years.

524
00:31:41,304 --> 00:31:43,427
No, it has to be now.

525
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:47,733
It's gotta be a three-way
and Tony's gonna go this time.

526
00:31:51,264 --> 00:31:51,874
I'm just...

527
00:31:54,103 --> 00:31:56,057
Tony's my oldest
friend on the council.

528
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,682
Well, couldn't you
go talk to him first?

529
00:32:00,714 --> 00:32:01,664
Put it on the table?

530
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,916
You know, may
the best man win...

531
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:05,218
Truth is...

532
00:32:07,522 --> 00:32:09,375
he can't win alone
against Royce, either.

533
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,832
He's got the bumper stickers,
but not much else.

534
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,609
Wants to run on education.

535
00:32:18,181 --> 00:32:18,849
I mean...

536
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:21,805
where do you go with that?

537
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:26,732
If I level with Tony and he
gets out, then I can't win.

538
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:29,688
I need him in the race.

539
00:32:37,078 --> 00:32:38,028
I feel like shit.

540
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:40,152
I really do.

541
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:09,614
Don't look like much.

542
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:14,307
This some weak ass
shit right here.

543
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:14,858
Hells yeah.

544
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,427
Man, we got lockers,
you got gear.

545
00:33:17,615 --> 00:33:18,812
It's all peelin' and shit.

546
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:19,902
Go long.

547
00:33:21,925 --> 00:33:22,758
Pass it here.

548
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:29,338
You gettin' me all dirty and shit.

549
00:33:29,526 --> 00:33:30,789
What's wrong with you?

550
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:32,361
Fuck you, bitch.

551
00:33:33,464 --> 00:33:36,261
We clocked the meet with Tweety Bird,
stayed on him overnight,

552
00:33:36,285 --> 00:33:39,505
tracked him to a possible stash house
and then home to nest in Woodlawn.

553
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:41,012
Got photos, his tags...

554
00:33:43,912 --> 00:33:44,628
What happened?

555
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:46,294
They ditched their phones.

556
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:50,200
The D.N.R.S and the wire all
died around three o'clock.

557
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:52,780
We were on line just shy 30 hours.

558
00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:57,601
I thought we had them on their
burners for a couple of weeks.

559
00:33:57,624 --> 00:34:00,135
Not anymore, it's a week at best.

560
00:34:00,545 --> 00:34:04,205
We just spent $9,000 and
change for 18 intercepts.

561
00:34:04,991 --> 00:34:06,225
Five of them non-pertinent.

562
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:10,318
That's close to $700 per drug call.

563
00:34:10,823 --> 00:34:12,242
Until we see which way this goes

564
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:14,436
shouldn't we get back
on Bernard and his girl?

565
00:34:14,483 --> 00:34:16,442
I mean, get a line on
the new phones at least.

566
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,651
But that'll only give us
what we just had: 30 hours.

567
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:24,085
Anyway to get ourselves
ahead of the curve?

568
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,483
If there were some way
to pre-wiretap the burners...

569
00:34:28,575 --> 00:34:29,220
What then?

570
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,730
Stick 'em on the rack
at Baba whatever's

571
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:33,595
and wait for Bernard
to show up that day?

572
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:35,167
The problem is the wireless people.

573
00:34:35,718 --> 00:34:37,610
They claim it takes
a minimum of four days

574
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:39,709
to process a court order
and that's only after

575
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,856
I had my office threatened
to go public on them.

576
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,097
Four days to hit
a couple of keystrokes.

577
00:34:44,144 --> 00:34:44,789
Bullshit.

578
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:47,716
What if...

579
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:51,763
no way.

580
00:34:52,502 --> 00:34:53,710
I know what you're thinking.

581
00:34:53,721 --> 00:34:55,563
I just thought the
same fucking thing.

582
00:34:58,948 --> 00:34:59,781
Alright, look, man.

583
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:01,517
You wanna take your
left foot out, man.

584
00:35:02,807 --> 00:35:04,801
Hey, unc's playin'
wit my man's feet.

585
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,279
Yeah, he smellin' up my ass, too.

586
00:35:06,593 --> 00:35:08,082
Stop with the damn clownin', man.

587
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,942
How you gonna learn somethin'
actin' like a damn fool?

588
00:35:13,326 --> 00:35:15,989
Ain't no big mystery why
your face got tattooed.

589
00:35:16,012 --> 00:35:18,061
Shit, that man can't
talk to you like that.

590
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:20,266
I seen his ragged ass up
the spot, copin' vials.

591
00:35:20,278 --> 00:35:22,166
Yeah, probably pimps his ass, too.

592
00:35:22,952 --> 00:35:24,125
Listen, motherfucker.

593
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:25,732
Yeah, bitch, touch me.

594
00:35:26,436 --> 00:35:28,020
Touch a juvenile, see what happen.

595
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:30,612
Let's bounce.

596
00:35:31,457 --> 00:35:32,137
Bitch ass.

597
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:33,475
Faggot.

598
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,173
Chump ass.

599
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:46,544
Lester.

600
00:35:53,052 --> 00:35:54,495
First time I seen him smoking.

601
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:56,196
Tough habit.

602
00:35:57,252 --> 00:35:59,210
And pacing like a motherfuck, too.

603
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:02,561
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

604
00:36:52,735 --> 00:36:55,454
<i>Bay Wireless Connect 411.
What city and state?</i>

605
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,498
Baltimore, Maryland.

606
00:36:59,255 --> 00:37:00,651
<i>How may I help you?</i>

607
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:01,718
Baltimore police.

608
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:04,747
<i>Any particular department?</i>

609
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:06,729
Western District police.

610
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:09,791
<i>Is this mergency?</i>

611
00:37:11,468 --> 00:37:12,430
Non-emergency.

612
00:37:13,627 --> 00:37:16,149
Man, they just did you
with the bum rush.

613
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,885
That's what they do.

614
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:21,216
They past expert at pluckin' nerves.

615
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:24,946
You just gotta remember,
they barely house broke.

616
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:27,017
I'm tellin' you, man,
you wouldn't believe it.

617
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,621
They was all wild and shit.
Wouldn't listen.

618
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,237
Andre, I want you to crowd him.

619
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:33,445
Yes, sir, crowd him.

620
00:37:33,527 --> 00:37:34,161
Alright.

621
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:43,518
Time!

622
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:48,599
You gotta set your
mind to stick with it.

623
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,300
When those two stumbled in here,
they was wilder than wild.

624
00:37:54,382 --> 00:37:55,673
Now they comin' everyday.

625
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,957
Yes, sir, no, sir.

626
00:37:59,283 --> 00:38:00,163
Still pretty rough

627
00:38:00,174 --> 00:38:02,567
but you know with the right
breaks, they gonna make it.

628
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,248
How?

629
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,825
Try as they might,
I don't let 'em fail.

630
00:38:08,378 --> 00:38:10,713
You do that, it messes
with their mind.

631
00:38:11,545 --> 00:38:14,337
Pretty soon, they run out
of their little bag of tricks.

632
00:38:18,197 --> 00:38:19,253
What you think of that?

633
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:23,898
Pretty weak.

634
00:38:24,379 --> 00:38:25,025
Ain't weak.

635
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,523
That's the startin' point...

636
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:36,936
Naw, naw, I can't
put a name on him

637
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:38,520
but I seen him 'round.

638
00:38:38,669 --> 00:38:40,018
He's off a west side.

639
00:38:40,476 --> 00:38:43,256
He ain't no drug dealer,
less he doin' it on the Q.T.

640
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:45,766
You can't go at him, game him?

641
00:38:46,341 --> 00:38:48,675
I don't know, Kima,
I mean, it be pressin'.

642
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:50,511
What about her?

643
00:38:50,851 --> 00:38:51,402
Squeak.

644
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:53,220
Offa Lanvale.

645
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,396
Yeah, she used to boost
for Turtle Wells', old mob.

646
00:38:57,912 --> 00:38:59,402
She lost a little bit of weight too.

647
00:38:59,414 --> 00:39:01,373
I mean, lookin' a lot
better than I remember

648
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,238
and I remember a lot
about that girl.

649
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,015
Damn, Bubs, is there anybody
westside you don't know?

650
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:09,220
Jus' citizens an' shit.

651
00:39:12,411 --> 00:39:13,839
My C.I. knows the girl.

652
00:39:14,155 --> 00:39:14,977
He can work her?

653
00:39:15,164 --> 00:39:16,138
If it's smooth, yeah.

654
00:39:16,936 --> 00:39:17,475
Check this.

655
00:39:23,057 --> 00:39:24,179
That's Western District?

656
00:39:24,817 --> 00:39:26,225
Stringer's calling the Western?

657
00:39:26,436 --> 00:39:27,832
Maybe he's surrendering.

658
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:31,435
After all the work we've done,
I'd never forgive the sonofabitch.

659
00:39:35,924 --> 00:39:37,495
Go down. Go down and out.

660
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:43,478
Sweet!

661
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:44,639
I got hands.

662
00:39:51,513 --> 00:39:53,355
What's up?
My knuckleheads didn't post?

663
00:39:53,636 --> 00:39:55,619
They did, but they left.

664
00:39:58,352 --> 00:39:59,044
Over here.

665
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:05,953
You lookin' for
a discount, old man?

666
00:40:06,628 --> 00:40:08,094
Naw, but I'm lookin' for you.

667
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,077
Why somethin' come up missin'?

668
00:40:10,581 --> 00:40:12,329
Came past to apologize.

669
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:14,476
I'm new at this coachin' thin'.

670
00:40:14,487 --> 00:40:16,587
An' I got us off on the wrong foot.

671
00:40:17,174 --> 00:40:20,890
I ain't gonna leave it between us,
you thinkin' I gave up on y'all.

672
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:24,703
Motherfucker's memory weak as shit.
We the ones bailed out on him.

673
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:29,404
Anyway, I'm here now.

674
00:40:35,163 --> 00:40:36,086
Let me understand:

675
00:40:36,121 --> 00:40:38,748
You want to sell drug traffickers
a series of cell phones

676
00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:41,060
that are pre-approved
for telephonic intercepts.

677
00:40:41,811 --> 00:40:42,995
And you want me

678
00:40:43,535 --> 00:40:46,550
to sign off on court-ordered taps
on a bunch of phones that

679
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,095
at the time I am signing the order

680
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:51,449
have not been used for any
illegal activity whatsoever.

681
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:53,921
If you're looking for
precedents, your honor?

682
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:54,707
There aren't any.

683
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,487
It's circumstantial P.C. at best.

684
00:41:02,813 --> 00:41:04,033
What the hell, let's do it.

685
00:41:04,866 --> 00:41:08,455
Let the court of appeals sort it
out, if it even gets that far.

686
00:41:18,493 --> 00:41:19,490
Quite the legal mind.

687
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,101
Buy you a drink?

688
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,517
Why the fuck
you comin' up behind me?

689
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:50,725
Sorry.

690
00:42:10,252 --> 00:42:10,932
Bushy Top.

691
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:13,771
You called, I didn't know if
I'd find you here so late.

692
00:42:13,783 --> 00:42:15,601
Just getting ready
for COMSTAT tomorrow.

693
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,844
So what's up, Major?

694
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,939
Your unit is still working...

695
00:42:23,795 --> 00:42:25,003
a drug war, right?

696
00:42:25,038 --> 00:42:26,082
Working it hard.

697
00:42:27,138 --> 00:42:30,427
Does the name Avon Barksdale
do anythin' for you?

698
00:42:31,393 --> 00:42:32,237
He's a player?

699
00:42:32,354 --> 00:42:33,281
He's the main guy.

700
00:42:33,692 --> 00:42:36,061
We thought he was down,
but he popped up in september.

701
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,556
You add him to the equation,
it goes a long way

702
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,811
to explaining the violence.

703
00:42:41,278 --> 00:42:43,202
So it wouldn't be
a stretch if he got shot?

704
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:44,386
You heard he got shot?

705
00:42:45,641 --> 00:42:47,749
You know when or where?
I could run it out quick.

706
00:42:47,784 --> 00:42:49,227
Naw, ain't gonna make no difference

707
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:51,726
he didn't post up at an
emergency room from what I hear.

708
00:42:54,752 --> 00:42:57,974
Major, I'm gonna be straight with you.
We're runnin' wires into his people

709
00:42:58,854 --> 00:43:00,379
but we're barely
above the street.

710
00:43:00,402 --> 00:43:02,397
So far, we haven't even
put an eyeball on him.

711
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,600
Suppose to be layin' his head there.

712
00:43:10,808 --> 00:43:13,518
I need you to check that out,
get back to me as soon as you can.

713
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:14,597
You got a C.I., huh?

714
00:43:14,797 --> 00:43:16,918
You wanna see if your
man's creds are bonafide.

715
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,605
Don't try to play me, Bushy Top.

716
00:43:20,273 --> 00:43:22,103
I didn't say male,
I didn't say female.

717
00:43:23,229 --> 00:43:23,687
Alright.

718
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:26,162
I'll get a surveillance
goin' right away.

719
00:43:26,232 --> 00:43:28,925
According to my source,
Barksdale's name is on the paperwork.

720
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,734
No shit.

721
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,520
You get the confirmation on
that, call me back on my cell.

722
00:43:37,711 --> 00:43:39,318
Good luck tomorrow.

723
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:40,128
Yeah, right.

724
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:11,064
Sham.

725
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:14,619
Shamrock.

726
00:44:16,671 --> 00:44:18,337
Run these over to Levy for me.

727
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:19,944
Tell him I want a read on it.

728
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:21,352
A read?

729
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:22,959
Fresh eyes.

730
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,481
Tell him I'll call him tomorrow.

731
00:44:25,986 --> 00:44:26,478
A- ight.

732
00:44:33,722 --> 00:44:35,071
Come on, Mr. Bodyguard.

733
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:07,268
And so, we're gonna
come at her like that.

734
00:45:07,726 --> 00:45:09,732
So you gonna give me
these phones to sell?

735
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,890
The money comes back, Bubs.

736
00:45:12,183 --> 00:45:12,758
All of it?

737
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,919
- Is that Beadie Russell?
- Looks like.

738
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,881
Whoa, yo, you can't
turn from this lane.

739
00:45:30,757 --> 00:45:32,106
Sweet Beatrice Russ...

740
00:45:36,498 --> 00:45:37,695
I was just gonna say, "hey. "

741
00:45:43,853 --> 00:45:44,838
North and Pulaski.

742
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:48,935
The photo was taken at four P.M.,
prime time for street-level dealing.

743
00:45:51,246 --> 00:45:52,923
That is Riggs and Calhoun.

744
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:55,422
Mount and Fayette.

745
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,263
Edmondson and Brice.

746
00:45:57,885 --> 00:45:59,247
It's your old foot post, Deputy.

747
00:46:00,232 --> 00:46:01,593
I know where it is, Major...

748
00:46:02,695 --> 00:46:05,616
what I don't know and
very much want to know is

749
00:46:06,027 --> 00:46:07,915
where is the west
Baltimore drug trade?

750
00:46:08,596 --> 00:46:12,498
I hope, major, these are not staged
photographs you're showing us.

751
00:46:12,521 --> 00:46:13,976
No, sir, they are not.

752
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,283
No, Deputy, I found another approach.

753
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:18,879
I'm all ears, Bunny.

754
00:46:19,841 --> 00:46:21,039
I moved them off the corners.

755
00:46:21,098 --> 00:46:24,394
Goddamnit, don't be coy
with me, Major. I can see that.

756
00:46:25,121 --> 00:46:27,784
What I want to know is how the
fuck you managed to move them

757
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:29,450
and where the fuck they are now.

758
00:46:31,303 --> 00:46:31,937
Deputy

759
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:36,359
I don't know quite
how to put this, but we...

760
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:38,740
I mean, I...

761
00:46:40,558 --> 00:46:43,017
I began by identifying those
areas of my district where

762
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:44,997
drug trafficking was least harmful

763
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:48,672
I proceeded to push all street-level
dealing towards those areas.

764
00:46:49,235 --> 00:46:50,267
Now at first

765
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,323
dealing with the juveniles
on them corners, had little success.

766
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:57,045
But ultimately

767
00:46:57,842 --> 00:47:01,256
by rounding up all the mid-level
dealers in my district

768
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:03,952
and making an offer
they couldn't refuse

769
00:47:04,035 --> 00:47:05,970
- I was able to...
- You made them an offer?

770
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:07,436
Yes, sir.

771
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:15,606
Either they move their people
to one of three designated areas

772
00:47:16,486 --> 00:47:19,125
where drug enforcement was
not a district priority...

773
00:47:20,228 --> 00:47:23,184
or they face the wrath of every
able-bodied soul in my district.

774
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:28,606
Major, I don't understand.

775
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,846
The only time we can
hold a drug corner

776
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,735
is when we assign
officers to stand there.

777
00:47:33,474 --> 00:47:36,649
Your slides don't suggest any
concerted deployment on any corners.

778
00:47:37,423 --> 00:47:38,678
How were you able to...

779
00:47:38,701 --> 00:47:41,470
Jesus christ, you nit,
don't you see what he's done.

780
00:47:42,537 --> 00:47:43,828
He's legalized drugs!

781
00:47:45,068 --> 00:47:47,332
Actually, I elected to ignore them.

782
00:47:47,977 --> 00:47:50,617
You lost your fucking mind.
He's lost his fucking mind.

783
00:47:51,848 --> 00:47:55,215
You. In my office. Now!

784
00:47:58,165 --> 00:47:59,326
That's it, gentleman.

785
00:48:26,108 --> 00:48:26,812
She's a go.

786
00:48:27,457 --> 00:48:28,407
Showtime, Bubs.

787
00:48:41,763 --> 00:48:42,936
Oh, shit.

788
00:48:44,086 --> 00:48:45,153
Sister Squeak.

789
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:46,350
Bottom-end Bubbles.

790
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:47,992
How you stand, girl?

791
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,083
Been a long time.

792
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:50,606
T- shirts?

793
00:48:50,782 --> 00:48:52,705
<i>What the hell kinda
money is in t-shirts?</i>

794
00:48:53,022 --> 00:48:54,277
<i>Girl, you just don't know. </i>

795
00:48:54,453 --> 00:48:55,420
<i>But how's your game?</i>

796
00:48:55,456 --> 00:48:56,605
<i>I heard you was locked up. </i>

797
00:48:56,617 --> 00:48:58,385
<i>Shit, I been on paper for a year. </i>

798
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,637
<i>- I got some things going.
- I can see that. </i>

799
00:49:01,012 --> 00:49:01,880
<i>You look good. </i>

800
00:49:01,904 --> 00:49:02,655
How's he doing?

801
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,520
He'd talk a cat off a fish cart.

802
00:49:04,836 --> 00:49:06,221
<i>A-ight, Bubs, I gotta get. </i>

803
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,018
Alright, I see you later on.

804
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:12,393
Yo, Squeak, Squeak.

805
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:13,953
I 'bout forgot.

806
00:49:14,692 --> 00:49:16,534
I can sell you one
of these, real cheap.

807
00:49:16,545 --> 00:49:17,890
If you got use for the shits...

808
00:49:21,597 --> 00:49:23,204
I'm fuckin' dead.

809
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:25,386
You mean, we're fuckin' dead.

810
00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:26,981
We're all dead behind this shit.

811
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:29,187
Jesus christ.

812
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:32,213
What I did, I did knowingly
and on my own.

813
00:49:33,445 --> 00:49:35,275
My men had nothin' to do with this.

814
00:49:35,638 --> 00:49:37,785
They thought it was part
of some elaborate trap.

815
00:49:38,955 --> 00:49:41,852
So if you need me to fall on
that sword, I'm good with that.

816
00:49:42,767 --> 00:49:43,823
You're good with it?

817
00:49:44,222 --> 00:49:48,163
Hey, you know I got my vacation time,
my last 30 in a couple months.

818
00:49:49,008 --> 00:49:50,709
So, if you need me
to fall, I'm ready.

819
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,110
But don't let me hear
that you're taking

820
00:49:54,111 --> 00:49:55,847
any punitive action
against my people.

821
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:57,981
Because I can get on the soapbox

822
00:49:57,982 --> 00:50:00,679
and I can lie as good as
the next man, if I have to.

823
00:50:01,992 --> 00:50:03,646
Are you threatening me?

824
00:50:06,145 --> 00:50:07,306
I believe I am, sir.

825
00:50:08,948 --> 00:50:09,803
My apologies.

826
00:50:11,586 --> 00:50:14,683
Bunny, you cocksucker, I got
give it to you, a brilliant idea.

827
00:50:15,023 --> 00:50:18,718
Insane and illegal, but stone
fuckin' brilliant nonetheless.

828
00:50:20,605 --> 00:50:21,906
After all my puttin' my foot up

829
00:50:21,907 --> 00:50:24,194
people's asses to decrease
the numbers, he comes in

830
00:50:24,652 --> 00:50:28,793
and in one stroke, gets
a fuckin' 14% decrease.

831
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:32,864
Fuckin' shame it's gonna
end our careers, but still.

832
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:37,345
You're all probably tired
of hearin' from me, but...

833
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:43,409
I brought these.

834
00:50:44,535 --> 00:50:45,356
Letters...

835
00:50:46,142 --> 00:50:49,779
from community associations,
ministers, business people, citizens.

836
00:50:51,573 --> 00:50:52,695
And they're all positive.

837
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:56,601
They're all happy that the
dealers are off the corners.

838
00:50:57,668 --> 00:51:00,308
You think that's
gonna save our asses?

839
00:51:01,715 --> 00:51:02,290
Do you?

840
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:05,066
No, I guess not, but...

841
00:51:06,673 --> 00:51:08,233
that and my badge is all I got.

842
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:12,538
I might have your badge,
Major, but not today.

843
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:16,889
I don't want to draw any attention
to this shit before we're...

844
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:18,672
ready to speak to it.

845
00:51:19,927 --> 00:51:23,868
So if you have any vacation
time, you're taking it now.

846
00:51:24,688 --> 00:51:29,204
Do not report for
a shift until notified.

847
00:51:40,454 --> 00:51:41,193
Oh...

848
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:44,372
one more thing, sir.

849
00:51:45,556 --> 00:51:48,014
A "Sun" reporter is
aware of my deployment.

850
00:51:49,327 --> 00:51:51,122
I told him an investigation
was pending

851
00:51:52,107 --> 00:51:53,527
he promised to delay the article.

852
00:51:54,582 --> 00:51:55,087
How long?

853
00:51:56,084 --> 00:51:58,489
About a week, tops.

854
00:52:04,608 --> 00:52:07,450
I was with Superstroke on the
pool circuit in the early days.

855
00:52:07,649 --> 00:52:09,808
But mostly pickpocketin'
and short cons.

856
00:52:10,547 --> 00:52:14,054
I did the long distance access card
heist before cell phones got popular.

857
00:52:14,582 --> 00:52:15,450
You crept numbers?

858
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:18,621
Yeah, I favored the airports, yeah.

859
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:20,187
Can you still read numbers?

860
00:52:20,603 --> 00:52:21,495
What's up with this?

861
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:23,594
Your man thinkin' I brought
him bad merchandise?

862
00:52:23,606 --> 00:52:26,022
'Cause if that what he think,
we can beat feet right now.

863
00:52:26,031 --> 00:52:28,577
Damn, Bernard, why you
actin' all C.I.A. and shit?

864
00:52:28,623 --> 00:52:30,066
We tryin' to make money here.

865
00:52:30,137 --> 00:52:31,826
If you had to answer
to the people I do

866
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:33,853
your ass would be damn
more sight cautious, too.

867
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:34,770
That's all I'm sayin'.

868
00:52:34,794 --> 00:52:35,685
I appreciate caution.

869
00:52:36,313 --> 00:52:37,826
'Cause I'm hangin' out here too.

870
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:39,937
Give it a go.

871
00:52:40,665 --> 00:52:41,439
Use a cell phone.

872
00:52:52,428 --> 00:52:54,562
Marlene, you send
that copy off to Paris?

873
00:52:55,689 --> 00:52:56,580
Thank you, darling.

874
00:52:57,706 --> 00:52:59,224
That will work, I'm at the airport.

875
00:52:59,716 --> 00:53:00,690
The shuttle, yes...

876
00:53:19,671 --> 00:53:28,269
three, one, oh, double four, eight,
sixteen, ninety-one, double seven

877
00:53:28,633 --> 00:53:33,662
eight, three, one, two.
Now that last number might be a seven.

878
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:36,278
I'm not too sure with
these small keypads and all.

879
00:53:36,876 --> 00:53:37,920
We can do business.

880
00:53:41,937 --> 00:53:42,500
That's it.

881
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:45,573
One two, one two, one two.

882
00:53:46,734 --> 00:53:47,743
One two, that's it.

883
00:53:48,482 --> 00:53:49,726
One two, there you go.

884
00:53:50,777 --> 00:53:53,065
Alright, there it is.
Now you gettin' it.

885
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:54,789
Keep that left hand up.

886
00:53:58,437 --> 00:53:59,024
Hey.

887
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:00,162
Hey.

888
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:02,517
Alright.

889
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,983
Watch your balance now.

890
00:54:04,147 --> 00:54:05,014
Don't lean forward.

891
00:54:05,015 --> 00:54:07,236
Don't lean too much, don't
lean too forward, alright?

892
00:54:07,256 --> 00:54:09,649
Alright, let's go. Don't lean
too forward, that's right.

893
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:11,045
One two, pivot...

894
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:12,120
You're kidding.

895
00:54:13,141 --> 00:54:14,959
Tell me he's kidding.

896
00:54:16,706 --> 00:54:17,786
You're kidding, right?

897
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:21,680
He did it without our knowledge.

898
00:54:21,821 --> 00:54:23,044
Without your knowledge.

899
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:25,871
Well, that's worse.
You're the Commissioner...

900
00:54:26,387 --> 00:54:27,713
Was the Commissioner.

901
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:31,725
You think the buck's gonna stop
in this office, you're wrong.

902
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:37,105
If I might, these are letters
from people in his district.

903
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:40,648
Ministers, business
people, voters...

904
00:54:41,457 --> 00:54:42,677
all glowing reports.

905
00:54:43,428 --> 00:54:47,627
And there's the 14% reduction
in crime, in the Western.

906
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:50,407
That's not an anomaly.

907
00:54:51,217 --> 00:54:52,448
It's hard data.

908
00:54:53,692 --> 00:54:56,113
Now, we can clean it up,
make it go away.

909
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,776
The press might already
have wind of it

910
00:54:58,787 --> 00:55:02,682
but we can explain that as
some sort of a new initiative.

911
00:55:03,538 --> 00:55:05,298
Trap high-end drug dealers...

912
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:07,648
14%?

913
00:55:08,856 --> 00:55:12,997
If we handle this right, we
might all get out from underneath.

914
00:55:13,607 --> 00:55:14,850
No mud on anybody.

915
00:55:17,832 --> 00:55:19,322
No, no.

916
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,451
I trusted you, Erv, I really did.

917
00:55:23,944 --> 00:55:25,070
You let me down.

918
00:55:25,903 --> 00:55:28,028
Now, this thing goes wrong,
no tellin' the damage.

919
00:55:28,052 --> 00:55:29,541
On this, you walk point.

920
00:55:29,741 --> 00:55:32,345
That's the way things work, Erv.
You know it as well as I do.

921
00:55:39,451 --> 00:55:40,225
Thank you, Ervin.

922
00:55:41,996 --> 00:55:44,037
I'll be over shortly
to see the detailed plan

923
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,207
on how this shit gets
cleaned up immediately.

924
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,768
If you could call this shit
something other than what it is...

925
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,105
Don't even think it.

926
00:56:14,433 --> 00:56:15,653
Way it works is this:

927
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:19,313
If you don't re-up the minutes
on your cell phone before 60 days

928
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,550
the wireless company
recycles the phone number.

929
00:56:21,597 --> 00:56:22,923
And that's where I get them.

930
00:56:23,404 --> 00:56:26,242
I put the word out on the street
that I'm buying tossed-off burners.

931
00:56:26,254 --> 00:56:27,497
Payin' two dollars a pop.

932
00:56:27,756 --> 00:56:29,480
Street people bring me hundreds.

933
00:56:29,855 --> 00:56:32,339
I bring 'em in here to my niece
she jiggles the computer

934
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:35,354
juices them up another 200
minutes on a bogus account.

935
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:40,198
And that automatically extends the
life of the phone for another 60 days.

936
00:56:40,761 --> 00:56:43,146
She charges me 20
on each phone on her end.

937
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:45,797
I double it or more
on the street to make mine.

938
00:56:46,525 --> 00:56:47,592
So what you sayin'?

939
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,744
Baby, a standard
Trac phone, with two

940
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:53,594
maybe 400 minutes on it
gonna run you 150, 200, easy.

941
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:58,321
I charge you an even 100,
you clear 50 on each phone.

942
00:56:58,427 --> 00:57:00,505
That's if'in you can back
them up with receipts.

943
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:03,145
I gotta show receipts lookin'
like they from different places

944
00:57:03,168 --> 00:57:03,895
or I can't play.

945
00:57:05,784 --> 00:57:07,309
Can we accommodate the good man?

946
00:57:07,895 --> 00:57:09,960
Damn, Calvin, you know
I got the bingo tonight.

947
00:57:22,822 --> 00:57:25,168
Look, friend, I ain't sure
you want to be around here.

948
00:57:25,344 --> 00:57:27,573
And I'm damn sure we're
gettin' tired of havin' you.

949
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:28,488
That plain enough?

950
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:29,496

952
00:57:32,218 --> 00:57:34,646
But I ain't gonna stop coming
round till I run up on Omar.

00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:36,312
