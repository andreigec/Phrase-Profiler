1
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:33,059
What's up?

2
00:00:34,832 --> 00:00:36,197
Great view.

3
00:00:38,535 --> 00:00:40,366
Harbor, I mean.

4
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:46,303
It's fucking picturesque, is what it is.

5
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,502
Every morning I ask myself,
"Is today the day I drive down...

6
00:00:49,613 --> 00:00:51,774
"to Fort Armistead, stare out at the harbor?"

7
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:54,578
No, I figure eventually,
if I mind my own business...

8
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:57,518
Uncle Frank will wake my ass up
at 7:00 in the morning...

9
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:01,523
tell me to get my ass down there
for some mysterious fucking reason.

10
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:10,358
Good anchorage, good cranes...

11
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:14,335
good railroads, close to I-95.
Lot of people ready to work, right?

12
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:16,403
That's my fucking town.

13
00:01:18,342 --> 00:01:20,469
Except, the thing is,
we're another 110 miles...

14
00:01:20,577 --> 00:01:23,410
for any ship coming up
from Hampton Roads. An extra day.

15
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:24,913
So why come?

16
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:26,915
Unless you know your cargo's
gonna move...

17
00:01:27,017 --> 00:01:29,076
fast and clean through the port.

18
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:31,916
Why offload in Baltimore,
except that a Baltimore gang...

19
00:01:32,022 --> 00:01:34,820
can turn your ship around
faster than any other port...

20
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:36,756
and will make sure your cargo...

21
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,455
all your cargo, gets where it needs to go
faster than anywhere else.

22
00:01:40,564 --> 00:01:42,964
Like you guys never stole nothing
back in the day.

23
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:45,399
We ain't back in the day, Nicky.

24
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:49,597
When was the last time
you saw trucks backed up for three miles...

25
00:01:49,707 --> 00:01:50,833
outside Patapsco terminal?

26
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:53,876
If it wasn't for the car-ships,
we would be starving.

27
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:56,442
The cameras come back.

28
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:57,836
I'm serious.

29
00:01:57,948 --> 00:02:01,645
They come back today, we tell the shipper
we lost the can in the stacks.

30
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:04,550
They're gone. We turned them over already.

31
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,281
To who?

32
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:16,157
You know the Tasco line's a cunt hair away
from taking their business down to Norfolk.

33
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:19,702
- I don't need this shit right now.
- I do, Uncle Frank, I need the money.

34
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:22,795
- You ain't hearing me!
- What? You think this shit is easy?

35
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:26,342
You think it's fucking easy?
You try living on five or six days a month.

36
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:30,038
See how fast it puts you on your ass.
I am on my ass, Uncle Frank.

37
00:02:30,147 --> 00:02:31,808
You need money, you come to me.

38
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:34,145
Frankie Sobotka is
Father fucking Christmas...

39
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:35,650
on the docks lately.

40
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:38,847
- No doubt, his pockets are full.
- You think it's for me?

41
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,590
Is that what you think?

42
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:43,626
It ain't about me, Nick!

43
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:48,030
I know, I'm sorry.

44
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:52,827
You got Ziggy mixed up in this.
Jesus, Nick, what the fuck are you thinking?

45
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,133
Me and Zig are gonna talk on this
long and hard.

46
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:13,946
Come on, let's go to work.

47
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,520
How much?

48
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,687
Twenty.

49
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:22,061
- Three-way split.
- Who's the inside man?

50
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,224
You don't know?

51
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:28,603
Fuck you then, I ain't no snitch.

52
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:34,409
Nobody should flash too much money.
You know that much, right?

53
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:37,271
Yeah.

54
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:16,712
Toxicology's coming back positive
for strychnine.

55
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:19,304
10%, 12%. It's pretty well laced.

56
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,906
This was intentional?

57
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:24,452
That's the ME's call, but I've seen
street packages cut all the time...

58
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:25,715
with all kinds of chemicals.

59
00:05:25,822 --> 00:05:28,757
You don't use too much,
you give a weak package some kick.

60
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:31,760
People start thinking you're high-grade,
when what you got is...

61
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:34,524
stepped-on trash
with a little bit of rat poison mixed in.

62
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:37,395
Too much rat poison,
you got people falling out, like we got.

63
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:39,867
Be nice to have a few answers
for those reporters.

64
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,096
What do they wanna know?

65
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:43,400
How it got in, what we're doing, the usual.

66
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:45,134
It got in like everything gets in.

67
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:47,938
If you can't win
the war on drugs in a prison...

68
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:50,269
where the hell you gonna win it? I ask you.

69
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,871
Listen, if it were one or two dead,
it would fade.

70
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:55,713
But five in one night,
and eight more in the infirmary?

71
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:57,309
We need to show the flag on this.

72
00:05:57,421 --> 00:05:59,855
What I'm gonna need is for you all
to wheel and deal.

73
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:01,254
What do you mean?

74
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:03,588
If this case gets made from an informant...

75
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:06,128
and you're gonna have
a couple dozen of them...

76
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,562
if you're ready to shave some years.

77
00:06:15,606 --> 00:06:16,834
Colonel.

78
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:25,738
- Jimmy.
- Winona.

79
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,920
Gilligan, little buddy.

80
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:35,720
Don't you have a job?

81
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:37,082
Ouch!

82
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,893
I smell fresh police work.

83
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:49,502
Okay, be like that.

84
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:52,733
You got some paper from inside the can?

85
00:06:52,843 --> 00:06:55,141
A letter, couple of envelopes,
some scraps of stuff?

86
00:06:55,245 --> 00:06:57,406
Yeah, everything's down
in your evidence control.

87
00:06:57,514 --> 00:07:00,244
- You got the submission slips?
- He does.

88
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,554
- Lester.
- You want to pull all of it?

89
00:07:09,793 --> 00:07:11,055
Hold it.

90
00:07:11,628 --> 00:07:14,222
Before you start dancing
with your Jane Doe...

91
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:17,164
I'm gonna need a little something from you
on the Gant case.

92
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:20,395
I got a full set of Ilene Nathan's teeth marks
on my hind parts.

93
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:22,836
- No problem, I got you covered.
- You found Omar?

94
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:25,032
I never lost him, my friend.

95
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:32,113
- He's got Omar?
- Bullshit.

96
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:33,546
Who's Omar?

97
00:07:46,196 --> 00:07:47,788
My papers are in.

98
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:50,857
They are.

99
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:53,332
You want out, you're out.

100
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:57,766
But I'm offering to clean the slate here.

101
00:07:58,308 --> 00:08:01,072
- You and me.
- Why?

102
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:04,772
The council vote is next week,
after which I'm upstairs.

103
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:07,283
Now, if I'm gonna give myself a chance...

104
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:10,615
to make my mark on this place,
I'll need good people.

105
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:13,284
People you can trust.

106
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:15,320
And you ain't that?

107
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,958
All right. You're a snake.

108
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:22,523
But you seem to know your business.

109
00:08:22,632 --> 00:08:25,123
I'm taking the bar exam in a month.

110
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:27,636
Why not put it off for a year or two...

111
00:08:27,738 --> 00:08:30,605
leave the department
with a major's pension?

112
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,866
Scalise is gonna retire this summer.

113
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:37,144
You do me a good turn
on this detail in southeast...

114
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:39,506
and you'll have that posting.

115
00:08:39,616 --> 00:08:41,447
Why would you do that?

116
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:43,212
I value you, Cedric.

117
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:47,616
You're arrogant and disloyal.

118
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:51,488
But maybe, given time,
you'll find a way to shine.

119
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:55,593
- What's the detail?
- Drug case, probably.

120
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,430
My sense of it is that Stan Valchek has got...

121
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:01,766
some personal issues with somebody
in one of the port unions.

122
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:03,806
He thinks they've got too much money.

123
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:06,933
And so, being Valchek, he gets a detail.

124
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,668
That it? Pretty thin.

125
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:12,742
I don't care if you make a case
for Valchek or not.

126
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:16,046
I do care that the old Polack
comes away from it...

127
00:09:16,153 --> 00:09:18,519
feeling he got his money's worth.

128
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:23,053
Valchek asked for me by name, didn't he?

129
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:27,254
You two are trading horses
and you need me in the corral.

130
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:35,294
How about this?

131
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:39,172
If I bring in the case...

132
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:42,501
you make the detail permanent
as a major case unit...

133
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:44,170
within CID.

134
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:45,578
Fair enough.

135
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:48,310
Just keep Valchek stroked
and make sure you bring in...

136
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:50,443
- a drug case or two.
- One other thing.

137
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:53,990
A promotion and the promise
of a specialized unit isn't enough?

138
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:56,558
I choose my own people.

139
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:00,760
Fuck me once, shame on you.

140
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:03,359
- Fuck me twice--
- Make a list.

141
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:06,568
Give it to Rawls. He'll pull who you want.

142
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:24,751
The shit do not make sense.
Some of them wasn't about nothing.

143
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:27,688
I mean, Tae? Lizard? If it was a hotshot...

144
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,555
they were after
some real lightweight motherfucks.

145
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:33,054
Yo, Dee, you want any Silver Surfers?

146
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:35,654
They tossing shit Tae had in his cell, man.

147
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:42,233
Whoever load that shit up
didn't know what he was doing.

148
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:46,400
My boy down the infirmary say the shit
was more rat poison than it was dope.

149
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:04,451
Fucking-A right.

150
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,603
Jane Doe, number five.

151
00:11:23,113 --> 00:11:24,478
Five.

152
00:11:38,895 --> 00:11:40,453
What's up, baby?

153
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:47,629
Not here, put it away.

154
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:50,840
Shot and a beer, darling.

155
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,804
Kept one for yourself, did you?

156
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:57,607
Them Japs, they make a nice little camera,
they do.

157
00:11:57,714 --> 00:12:01,013
- You even got film in that bitch?
- No, it's digital.

158
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:03,113
I know it's digital, so what?

159
00:12:03,219 --> 00:12:06,677
So, no film, look,
there's a computer chip inside.

160
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:09,853
You take that off,
you load the pictures onto the computer.

161
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,018
Thanks.

162
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:15,357
Ziggy.

163
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,524
Don't spread no cash around
for a while, all right?

164
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:21,263
Hell, no.

165
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:24,738
I might get a new clutch plate
put in Princess is all.

166
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,008
- Also, your father knows.
- How does he know?

167
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:30,841
Horse saw us, right?

168
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:35,241
Fuck me, he told?

169
00:12:35,352 --> 00:12:38,321
How long has Horse been tight
with your pop? Of course he told.

170
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:42,014
He's pissed, Zig. He ain't happy.

171
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:44,015
What did you say?

172
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:48,957
I told him we already
turned the cameras around...

173
00:12:49,065 --> 00:12:51,465
and after a while, he stopped yelling.

174
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:53,297
At you, maybe.

175
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:56,639
Anyway.

176
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,034
It's low profile for a while, all right?

177
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:01,371
All right.

178
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:11,082
You take a picture on that,
you don't have to take it to photomart...

179
00:13:11,187 --> 00:13:14,247
- to get it turned around?
- No, it goes on a computer.

180
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:22,626
I got to take a leak.

181
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:27,928
I go next, all right?

182
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:51,387
Pretty boy. Hey, there.

183
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:53,585
Christ, Ziggy.

184
00:14:02,172 --> 00:14:04,037
Jimmy, just a scheduling thing.

185
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,166
Sean was invited to Mark Lohrman's
birthday party on Saturday.

186
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:09,074
So you can pick him up there after 2:00.

187
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:12,546
I realize it's your weekend,
but Sean would be upset if he missed it.

188
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:14,014
Okay? Great.

189
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:19,286
Omar by the end of the week, Jimmy.
Ilene is on the warpath.

190
00:14:19,556 --> 00:14:21,615
Motherfucker, I am serious.

191
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:25,324
Mr. McNulty, this is Dr. Halpern's office.

192
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:27,555
You missed your six-month cleaning
on Tuesday...

193
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:28,892
and we haven't heard from you.

194
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:30,590
Give us a call, please.

195
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:33,995
McNulty, this is your dear friend
Ilene Nathan.

196
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:35,969
I indicted this piece-of-shit case...

197
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:38,870
because you swore to me
we had an eyeball witness...

198
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:52,119
Drive time is 6:38 in the a.m.
and we have reports of a...

199
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:10,701
- Go around, asshole.
- What'd you call me?

200
00:15:12,175 --> 00:15:13,972
I'm sleeping on this side.

201
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:16,841
Because you got to get up, everybody does?

202
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:20,907
Yup.

203
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:31,816
Wipe off the seat, Nick, I know you hit it.

204
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:40,999
- If I could fart now, I would.
- That's a surprise.

205
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:46,632
No chance for breakfast?

206
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,138
No. I'll stop by the bar.

207
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,406
No, you won't. You ain't got time.

208
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:53,812
You got to run me past my ma's
to pick up Ashley.

209
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:57,114
Shit, hurry up, then.
You know I got a ship to work today.

210
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:00,355
Your ma knows you got a ship, too.

211
00:16:02,158 --> 00:16:04,285
Don't go upstairs. Just head out the back.

212
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:07,386
I'll pick you up at the back
of the alley, all right?

213
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:12,264
Jesus, Nicky, we got a kid together.

214
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:15,470
What's the big deal we spend the night
in your folks' basement?

215
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:17,403
They're decent people.

216
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:32,484
- We ain't got time.
- I know.

217
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:36,320
- So, why you grabbing?
- They were staring right at me.

218
00:16:49,772 --> 00:16:51,637
I'll meet you out back.

219
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:57,278
So how do you get the container
off the ship, off the dock?

220
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,848
I guess if you wanted
to make sure your cargo...

221
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:03,009
isn't messed with, you'd want to get
with one of the checkers.

222
00:17:03,119 --> 00:17:05,110
- Who are they?
- Local 1514.

223
00:17:05,221 --> 00:17:07,451
They monitor
all the loading and offloading...

224
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:10,151
they match the manifests,
they tally the cargo.

225
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,093
Nothing goes in or out
without them putting it down somewhere.

226
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:14,754
- Or not.
- Or not.

227
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:17,723
So we need to talk to a checker.

228
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:19,360
What?

229
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:22,896
Black, white, Polish, Irish, Italian,
it doesn't matter.

230
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:24,630
No one talks to police.

231
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:27,642
How do you make a case then?

232
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:30,906
I patrol.

233
00:17:31,514 --> 00:17:32,879
I write traffic tickets.

234
00:17:32,982 --> 00:17:35,974
If we got an open container,
or a damaged container...

235
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:37,313
I take a report.

236
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,786
We got something stolen,
I take another report.

237
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:44,326
Someone gets something dropped on him
or gets run over by a front-end loader...

238
00:17:44,427 --> 00:17:46,554
- I keep writing.
- That's the job?

239
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:50,326
How long you been on?

240
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:53,493
- Two years.
- What did you do before that?

241
00:17:55,238 --> 00:17:58,435
I took tolls from people
at the Fort McHenry tunnel.

242
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:01,740
Which, I'm happy to say,
wasn't nearly as much fun.

243
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:04,409
Made $22,500
and went home tired every night...

244
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:07,074
until I walked by the office bulletin board
one night...

245
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:08,673
read the MDOT job posting.

246
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:12,812
Port Authority officers, Schedule one,
starting at $33,000 with benefits.

247
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,583
Toll-taking days were over?

248
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:22,658
Father of my two kids
went to Houston in '99...

249
00:18:22,865 --> 00:18:25,561
hasn't so much as called in three years.

250
00:18:25,668 --> 00:18:27,499
I wasn't gonna make it on $22,500.

251
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:29,264
Not with kids, I wasn't.

252
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:33,468
Did you want to be a police?

253
00:18:57,934 --> 00:18:59,663
- Could've been me the other night.
- True.

254
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:04,339
Except for all of a sudden,
you up and tell me to stop doing that.

255
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,931
Avon to the rescue. How did you know?

256
00:19:07,777 --> 00:19:10,371
I figured you were gonna be
bringing your ass in here...

257
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,471
to thank me for pulling you off of that shit.

258
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:15,346
Five dead. More in the infirmary.

259
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:18,614
- How did you know?
- I did as your uncle should...

260
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:21,880
because I'm concerned about
you fucking yourself up.

261
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:23,757
You knew.

262
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:27,188
Look, man, I ain't had nothing to do with it.

263
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,623
I might know who did, though.

264
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:32,360
You practically running this place.
Who else could it be?

265
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:36,371
It ain't about what happened,
you understand?

266
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:40,233
It's about using what happened
to our advantage.

267
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:42,000
Play or you gonna get played.

268
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:44,272
I need to know that you ain't do that shit.

269
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,540
That's what I need to know.

270
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:48,845
I already said it.
You ain't gonna believe it, fuck it.

271
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:53,019
You can tell yourself that I spiked it,
but be grateful that you still standing.

272
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:54,646
Once you done with all that...

273
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:57,749
we can talk about how we start
shaving some of these years off.

274
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,589
And not just for me, for you, too.

275
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:02,687
They looking for the motherfucker
who brought that shit in here.

276
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,596
They need him to fall. And you know what?

277
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,692
I can give you a name.
I can give you the right name.

278
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:10,568
We can take that name
down to the assistant warden...

279
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,174
and we can get some of our lives back.

280
00:20:13,943 --> 00:20:15,171
You dig?

281
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:19,941
So, stay close.

282
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:22,483
This play on the inside,
this play on the outside...

283
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:24,450
we got it all covered.

284
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:31,284
I don't want no part of what you do no more.
You hear me?

285
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,829
So you can just leave me
the fuck out of that.

286
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:36,455
Whatever it is.

287
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,922
Anyone seen Omar?

288
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:17,562
We're back in!

289
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:21,600
Six ships in one day.

290
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:25,446
Ain't seen the terminal this busy in months.
Feels sweet.

291
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:27,741
Shit, look at this pretty bitch.

292
00:21:28,518 --> 00:21:31,715
- What the fuck are you wearing?
- Italian leather, all right?

293
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:34,112
In the middle of winter?
On the goddamn docks?

294
00:21:34,223 --> 00:21:36,589
- How much does that shit cost?
- $2,000.

295
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:39,661
For a goddamn jacket?
Are you out your fucking mind, Zig?

296
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:41,321
Fuck it.

297
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,864
$2,000 for a single goddamn jacket.

298
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:46,534
Jesus, Zig, you need therapy and shit.

299
00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:50,363
I figured an African-American
such as yourself would understand...

300
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:53,772
how a player such as myself
needs to take heed in the latest fashion.

301
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:57,004
But apparently,
you ain't got no fucking style neither.

302
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,978
- I'm gonna walk, all right?
- See you.

303
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:04,277
What?

304
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,188
What did I tell you about
not spreading no cash around?

305
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,157
Jesus Christ, Nicky, it's a fucking coat.

306
00:22:11,594 --> 00:22:15,086
I can tell people I'm paying for it
on installments or whatever.

307
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:19,163
But you got to admit, I do look pretty today.

308
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:20,326
I do.

309
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:28,472
The Greeks wanna talk to us.

310
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:29,906
What about?

311
00:22:30,913 --> 00:22:32,380
We did good by them.

312
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:33,940
Yeah?

313
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:37,682
But, for Christ sakes, Zig,
keep your shit quiet...

314
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:40,688
before half the fucking waterfront's
talking about us.

315
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:42,483
All right, no problem.

316
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:46,523
- All right. See you later.
- See you.

317
00:23:10,987 --> 00:23:12,386
Yo, quit it.

318
00:23:18,194 --> 00:23:19,183
Gentlemen.

319
00:23:20,196 --> 00:23:21,959
We don't need that now.

320
00:23:22,064 --> 00:23:24,294
- Say what?
- I don't give a shit about drugs.

321
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,665
Littering pisses me off, though.
You can pick that up when I'm gone.

322
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,330
I'm looking for a stick-up boy,
name of Omar.

323
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,768
Dark-skinned, thin guy
with a scar right down his face.

324
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:36,575
You boys would definitely know him
if you saw him...

325
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:38,943
because he's got a shotgun about yea-long.

326
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:42,506
He'll put it to your head
and steal your shit without thinking twice.

327
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:44,313
Does anyone know where he hangs?

328
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:47,253
Who he's running with?

329
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:51,959
What he's driving?

330
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:54,286
Fuck you, Officer.

331
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,065
The second package came
even weaker than the last.

332
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:04,969
It won't take the cut like it did before.

333
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:08,168
Fucking Atlanta shit cost more
and still not as good.

334
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:10,743
Came in at 25.

335
00:24:10,846 --> 00:24:12,871
All we can do is sprinkle it and bag it.

336
00:24:12,982 --> 00:24:14,279
And lose my money?

337
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,112
I lose my money.

338
00:24:19,522 --> 00:24:20,921
Step on that motherfucker.

339
00:24:21,023 --> 00:24:22,285
How hard?

340
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,119
Make it 10.

341
00:24:25,227 --> 00:24:27,388
- It's shit now.
- I know.

342
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:41,641
So the container itself leads us nowhere.
Fake addresses on either end.

343
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:44,004
Which leaves us the port itself.

344
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:47,439
Because whatever went wrong
on that ship was known to whoever...

345
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,347
was supposed to pick that container up.

346
00:24:49,452 --> 00:24:51,477
Which is why it stays on the dock.

347
00:24:51,587 --> 00:24:56,217
Bottom line is, we need to know more
about cargo moving off that terminal.

348
00:24:56,325 --> 00:24:59,351
How to do dirt.
And how to hide when you're doing dirt.

349
00:25:02,298 --> 00:25:04,289
Bottom line for me is different.

350
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:09,065
Bottom line for me is,
you guys should've held that ship.

351
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:12,470
For your crime scene, for your witnesses,
for the whole damn case.

352
00:25:12,575 --> 00:25:13,667
Sir, the witnesses--

353
00:25:13,776 --> 00:25:16,267
I don't care if they were
speaking Mandarin Chinese...

354
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:17,744
with a cocksucker's lisp.

355
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:21,374
They needed to see the inside of
an interrogation room. They were the case.

356
00:25:21,484 --> 00:25:23,918
We were in Philadelphia,
with no real jurisdiction...

357
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:26,886
dealing with foreign nationals
and no real probable cause.

358
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:30,356
I can only tell you
what it looks like from where I sit.

359
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,891
And from here, the view is
two of my detectives fucking the dog.

360
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:40,496
Thirteen homicides, 14, if we connect
the floater, and all of them red.

361
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:43,638
So what can I tell you?

362
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:47,004
If this case doesn't fall,
we're all gonna be stepping on our dicks...

363
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:48,770
trying to explain what happened.

364
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:53,671
So, work it as you see fit...

365
00:25:54,817 --> 00:25:56,148
but understand...

366
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:59,449
if I have to throw Burrell
a scapegoat or two...

367
00:25:59,822 --> 00:26:01,289
I got one to throw.

368
00:26:20,476 --> 00:26:21,704
Fuck me.

369
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:01,510
What did you want to talk to us about?

370
00:27:01,617 --> 00:27:05,109
If you are able to do like you did,
we have other things we can use.

371
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:06,188
Like what?

372
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:09,780
Fact is, we shook things up down there
snatching all them cameras.

373
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:13,559
It comes to expensive shit like that,
we got to lay back for a while.

374
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:15,687
Stuff we need is not like that.

375
00:27:16,198 --> 00:27:17,187
No?

376
00:27:20,503 --> 00:27:24,462
Acetone, sulfuric acid,
potassium permanganate.

377
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:27,474
- Chemicals?
- It's like paint thinner, shit like that.

378
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:30,943
What do you need with those?
Just go get them at the hardware store.

379
00:27:31,046 --> 00:27:33,344
No. We need much.

380
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:37,308
Metric tons. Five or ten tons.

381
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,150
Check and you'll see,
they make these things here.

382
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:43,692
Send them from here.
Tanks and tanks down at your docks.

383
00:27:46,695 --> 00:27:48,458
Good money for those.

384
00:27:52,935 --> 00:27:53,993
How much?

385
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:59,502
How much chemical? Two tons? Four?

386
00:28:00,142 --> 00:28:02,133
- Eight?
- I'll look into it.

387
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:23,563
Yo, Bubbles!

388
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:27,130
McNulty.

389
00:28:28,704 --> 00:28:30,262
My meanest man.

390
00:28:32,508 --> 00:28:34,032
Get in the car.

391
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,343
Where you been at, brother?

392
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,687
What did you get? Walkman.

393
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:53,759
You know how it works, Bubs.
You're going to pay taxes on this shit.

394
00:28:54,196 --> 00:28:57,165
Taxation without representation, you know?

395
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,563
I don't want much. I need Omar.

396
00:29:00,536 --> 00:29:01,867
Wild Omar?

397
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:05,035
You want us to wander around town...

398
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,802
looking for a crazy motherfucker
with a shotgun?

399
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,174
Him and me go way back,
it's a friendly thing.

400
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:12,975
If he's a friend,
you can find the motherfucker without us.

401
00:29:13,082 --> 00:29:16,711
No problem. Show me the receipt
for this shit, you're off the hook.

402
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:23,087
- Here.
- Keep it, part of my tax.

403
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:25,553
Your tax is Omar.

404
00:29:27,062 --> 00:29:29,292
I need a line by Friday, Bubs.

405
00:29:32,868 --> 00:29:33,857
Fuck!

406
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:38,130
My client will provide accurate information
as to the source of the tainted narcotics.

407
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,107
He can identify the method
by which contraband is smuggled...

408
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,872
into this institution,
as well as the people responsible.

409
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:45,571
Cellblock talk is cheap.

410
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:47,672
He'll give you what you need
to make a case...

411
00:29:47,783 --> 00:29:50,650
- if that's what you're interested in.
- Your terms?

412
00:29:50,753 --> 00:29:53,586
Mr. Barksdale is due
for a first parole hearing at 28 months.

413
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:55,452
We'd like to trim that to a year...

414
00:29:55,557 --> 00:29:57,991
and have your assurances
of institutional support...

415
00:29:58,093 --> 00:30:00,186
for work release and early parole.

416
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:02,057
One year on a seven-year bit?

417
00:30:02,431 --> 00:30:05,059
We are offering extraordinary cooperation
in this matter.

418
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:07,397
Mr. Barksdale's placing himself at risk...

419
00:30:07,503 --> 00:30:09,937
by offering information
implicating other prisoners...

420
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,631
and staff at MCI.

421
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,143
And I would only add that
Mr. Barksdale's extant conviction is his first.

422
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:18,076
He has no priors whatsoever.

423
00:30:19,081 --> 00:30:22,915
It's my recollection that a city police
got shot behind Mr. Barksdale's business.

424
00:30:23,018 --> 00:30:25,418
- No, sir.
- You don't remember that?

425
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:27,851
I remember the officer got shot.

426
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:31,722
And I remember being upset about that,
not only because the officer got shot...

427
00:30:31,827 --> 00:30:34,853
but because I knew it meant
there was gonna be more police on me.

428
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:38,592
I remember thinking, "Any time any fool
do something like shoot a police...

429
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:39,895
"it's bad on everyone."

430
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:42,232
I know that you know
that my name ain't nowhere...

431
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:44,635
on what happened to your friend.

432
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:49,767
I think what we're asking is reasonable
under the circumstances.

433
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,646
After all, until someone identifies the source
of the tainted heroin...

434
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:56,411
you could have
another five overdoses tomorrow.

435
00:30:56,618 --> 00:30:57,915
Or the day after.

436
00:30:59,922 --> 00:31:01,412
Consider the offer.

437
00:31:02,157 --> 00:31:03,556
But the next time we talk...

438
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,526
an assistant attorney general
has to be in the room.

439
00:31:19,742 --> 00:31:21,232
Tuna surprise?

440
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:25,646
Christ sakes, Ma,
I climbed all over two ships today.

441
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:28,775
How about a meal for that kind of day?

442
00:31:33,455 --> 00:31:37,016
- Where's Pop?
- He's at the bar with the horses.

443
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,194
Go tell him it's dinner.

444
00:32:02,718 --> 00:32:05,482
- We winning, Pop?
- Nicko.

445
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:07,521
You up today?

446
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:12,586
I was doing good,
but this year Gulfstream is killing me.

447
00:32:12,928 --> 00:32:15,158
Go easy. That's my inheritance.

448
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:21,736
After 25 years, I'm still ahead almost $7,000.

449
00:32:21,837 --> 00:32:24,635
You ought to let me take you up to Pimlico
when it opens.

450
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,605
Try your system out for real.

451
00:32:26,942 --> 00:32:28,273
Too tempting.

452
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,075
Just once.

453
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:36,275
Saw that the Cape Spruance
is over at Point West.

454
00:32:37,352 --> 00:32:39,445
Yeah, we offloaded her today.

455
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,726
You know we double-hulled her
down at number four.

456
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:54,230
Maybe two years before
the dry dock closed up.

457
00:32:55,204 --> 00:32:56,967
She still floats?

458
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:00,272
Of course she still floats.

459
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:04,440
You ever miss it, Pop?

460
00:33:06,915 --> 00:33:08,644
Wouldn't do no good.

461
00:33:12,688 --> 00:33:14,019
What's for dinner?

462
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,457
Tuna surprise.

463
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:32,666
You're loyal to your people.
I respect that, at least.

464
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,638
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

465
00:33:36,745 --> 00:33:39,111
Burrell wants you on this detail,
so I want you, too.

466
00:33:39,214 --> 00:33:41,614
I need your approval
for Freamon, Greggs, and Hauk.

467
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:44,584
- They're all CID.
- Correction.

468
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:49,015
You need my approval for everyone.
This may be Valchek's creation...

469
00:33:49,124 --> 00:33:52,116
but the detail is investigative
and comes under CID.

470
00:33:52,494 --> 00:33:55,190
If they work for me, they need my okay.

471
00:33:57,866 --> 00:34:01,358
Good news is, I got no problem
with anyone on your list.

472
00:34:02,704 --> 00:34:05,571
Except McNulty. No McNulty.

473
00:34:06,008 --> 00:34:08,670
Nothing that even resembles
the son of a bitch.

474
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:11,707
- That bad?
- He quits or he drowns.

475
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:16,144
That's the only two things get him
off the fucking boat, so help me God.

476
00:34:19,054 --> 00:34:21,887
You even know what
this detail's about, Lieutenant?

477
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,787
Some kind of beef that Valchek has.

478
00:34:23,892 --> 00:34:26,554
Two fucking Polacks
pissing on each other's leg.

479
00:34:26,762 --> 00:34:28,252
I heard.

480
00:34:28,964 --> 00:34:31,797
Anything to get you
out of the basement, Lieutenant?

481
00:34:46,715 --> 00:34:47,807
Girl.

482
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,424
No! Kima, who cares?

483
00:34:58,894 --> 00:35:02,625
We're gonna be there in five minutes
and they'll still be dumbass frat boys.

484
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:05,495
You got to start thinking,
what would a lawyer do?

485
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,431
What would a lawyer say?

486
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:10,703
Shakima Greggs, Esquire.

487
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:13,801
That's what I'm talking about.

488
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:27,053
- Get your ass down, fool.
- Fuck you, lady.

489
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:35,896
Ain't no lady.

490
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:42,767
- Bitch, drive it or lose it.
- Oh, my God, let's get out of here.

491
00:35:49,878 --> 00:35:54,440
Only the finest breeds can perform this well,
with this much heart and obedience.

492
00:35:55,484 --> 00:35:59,045
Obedience that brings out the champion
not only in show dogs...

493
00:35:59,154 --> 00:36:03,784
Look at that tiger go. A third generation
champion from Glassport.

494
00:36:03,892 --> 00:36:07,794
Even house pets that never knew
they had the blood of champions in them.

495
00:36:08,163 --> 00:36:09,653
To perform at this level...

496
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:12,359
an animal has to follow orders
without question.

497
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:13,525
It is not instinct.

498
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:14,863
Come on upstairs.

499
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,767
All dogs have instinct.

500
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:24,278
Jesus Christ.

501
00:36:38,693 --> 00:36:42,390
Nothing's on this side. Most chemicals
are over at the Fairfield terminals.

502
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:44,294
Who do we know at Fairfield?

503
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:47,793
Ott's brother-in-law works there.
You might try and touch him.

504
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:51,972
What do they want with those for, anyway?

505
00:36:52,074 --> 00:36:54,042
Beats the fuck out of me.

506
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,713
- Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Fuck, man, shit.

507
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:02,978
I didn't see you standing there
in all that sweet leather.

508
00:37:03,618 --> 00:37:06,519
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Clumsy, I guess.

509
00:37:06,655 --> 00:37:09,647
You can just go out
and steal a whole can full of baby wipes...

510
00:37:09,758 --> 00:37:11,521
and just clean yourself up.

511
00:37:14,996 --> 00:37:16,657
You fucking goof.

512
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:18,664
Dick.

513
00:37:23,271 --> 00:37:25,068
Shit, Lieutenant, I promised.

514
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,107
Think my woman's gonna give
a great big cheer when she hears about it?

515
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:31,805
- I was out the damn door.
- You don't know Cheryl.

516
00:37:31,913 --> 00:37:33,540
You don't know Marla.

517
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:36,313
If you want...

518
00:37:36,585 --> 00:37:39,179
I could use you inside,
like we did Prez last year.

519
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:41,414
If I hear the music, I'm gonna dance.

520
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:55,195
I'll tell your wife, if you tell mine.

521
00:38:06,448 --> 00:38:08,916
In the car, but not out in the open.

522
00:38:09,985 --> 00:38:11,475
Yo, Rock.

523
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:16,056
Be subtle with it, man.

524
00:38:17,192 --> 00:38:19,956
- You know what subtle means?
- Laid back and shit.

525
00:38:34,442 --> 00:38:36,967
- Good tunes, Pop?
- Yeah.

526
00:38:37,546 --> 00:38:39,377
Thanks for the phones.

527
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,089
I don't know, Bubs. I mean...

528
00:38:56,064 --> 00:38:58,430
if you go rolling over rocks...

529
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:01,267
then you're gonna get bit by a snake, right?

530
00:39:02,504 --> 00:39:04,597
Got to pay that tax, Johnny.

531
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:10,269
You got to give a working police his due.

532
00:39:15,684 --> 00:39:18,983
- So, Bee's working for Lamar?
- All of them work for Lamar.

533
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:21,315
He got that whole corner to hisself.

534
00:39:21,756 --> 00:39:24,657
You saying the stash is across the street
in the low-rises?

535
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:26,056
In the second court.

536
00:39:26,161 --> 00:39:29,688
They got it up in this one place
that got the boarded-up windows.

537
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:32,264
How many doors down from the end?

538
00:39:34,102 --> 00:39:35,433
Three.

539
00:39:40,242 --> 00:39:41,504
Yo, Pops.

540
00:39:50,585 --> 00:39:54,954
Anyone got a line on that wild boy
who likes to pop the shotty?

541
00:39:56,057 --> 00:39:58,423
- Omar?
- Yeah, I need Omar.

542
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:00,460
What do you want with Omar?

543
00:40:01,196 --> 00:40:02,993
Just want a word with him.

544
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:05,021
Just a word.

545
00:40:06,034 --> 00:40:08,127
You want to get with Omar...

546
00:40:08,637 --> 00:40:11,003
you need to stand out
on one of them corners...

547
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:13,006
with a big-ass package.

548
00:40:13,708 --> 00:40:16,506
You be talking to that nigger soon enough.

549
00:40:24,886 --> 00:40:26,547
You feel anything?

550
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:31,153
Let's go.

551
00:40:34,462 --> 00:40:35,690
Come on.

552
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:03,949
As agreed, the price of cooperation is
an agreement by the state parole officials...

553
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:07,358
to move Mr. Barksdale's
first parole hearing forward by 12 months...

554
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:10,521
and to credit him in the file
with cooperation in this matter.

555
00:41:10,632 --> 00:41:13,328
You can't make a case
on just some con's say so.

556
00:41:13,435 --> 00:41:15,062
We need the dope on the table.

557
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,330
Of course you do.

558
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:19,236
If, before the end of business today,
you effect a search...

559
00:41:19,341 --> 00:41:23,107
of Correctional Officer Tilghman's vehicle,
locker, and person...

560
00:41:23,211 --> 00:41:25,873
we are confident
sufficient evidence will be recovered.

561
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,345
"We are confident"?

562
00:41:27,682 --> 00:41:30,480
As far as D.O.C. is concerned,
this is a fair deal...

563
00:41:30,585 --> 00:41:33,281
if it takes the overdoses off our plate.

564
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:36,621
But if we come up empty on this...

565
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:38,881
You won't.

566
00:41:45,033 --> 00:41:46,398
Five will get you ten...

567
00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:48,799
that's the motherfucker
that spiked the packages.

568
00:41:48,903 --> 00:41:50,495
You have proof of this?

569
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:53,564
Then we make the case
that's there for us to make.

570
00:42:11,025 --> 00:42:13,858
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. New Orleans.

571
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,291
Lieutenant.

572
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:25,528
- Welcome to the southeast.
- Major, I understand you asked for me.

573
00:42:26,307 --> 00:42:28,901
My son-in-law can't say enough
in your favor.

574
00:42:29,043 --> 00:42:32,274
And, of course, you did him
a good turn last year, right?

575
00:42:33,014 --> 00:42:36,347
- You want to tell me about this target?
- Frank Sobotka.

576
00:42:36,885 --> 00:42:38,785
A union man down at the port.

577
00:42:39,287 --> 00:42:43,849
The motherfucker's showing a lot of money.
My gut says a drug connection.

578
00:42:44,092 --> 00:42:47,152
I can also tell you for a fact
that his people...

579
00:42:47,562 --> 00:42:50,429
will up and steal anything
that isn't nailed down.

580
00:42:50,632 --> 00:42:53,396
- You seen the off-site?
- Not yet.

581
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:55,799
I told my people to meet up here,
at the district.

582
00:42:55,904 --> 00:42:58,634
Pretty good digs. Come on, I'll show you.

583
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:05,671
It's from a young woman to her mother...

584
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:08,277
or at least an older woman.

585
00:43:08,883 --> 00:43:10,578
She mention any names?

586
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,345
There is an Anya here.

587
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:18,185
And from the way she writes,
I'm guessing it is a child.

588
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:22,890
It's almost ready, Father. Excuse me.

589
00:43:30,738 --> 00:43:34,174
- So who's she writing to?
- There is no name.

590
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:36,874
The letter is for the whole family.

591
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:38,941
But...

592
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:46,347
she signs, "Nadya." Her name is Nadya.

593
00:43:46,621 --> 00:43:48,953
- Nadya.
- Is she in trouble?

594
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:51,289
She's dead.

595
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,127
Anything in the letter to indicate
as to where these people live?

596
00:43:56,231 --> 00:43:58,665
If you had an envelope, I could...

597
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:02,866
The only thing specific she mentions,
is a church...

598
00:44:02,971 --> 00:44:06,804
St. Volodymyr, or St. Vladimir, and a priest.

599
00:44:07,442 --> 00:44:11,242
- Father Vasyl, it says.
- There's no names or places or...

600
00:44:11,379 --> 00:44:14,507
Across the water,
Father Vasyl is a common name...

601
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:17,508
and there are many St. Volodymyrs.

602
00:44:20,555 --> 00:44:23,251
But leave the letter. I will try.

603
00:44:24,626 --> 00:44:25,957
Thank you.

604
00:44:30,832 --> 00:44:35,292
I'm saying, if there isn't enough work,
then you could do something else, that's all.

605
00:44:35,403 --> 00:44:37,132
There's enough work.

606
00:44:41,643 --> 00:44:44,111
Fact is, I came into
some back pay I was owed...

607
00:44:44,212 --> 00:44:46,077
from about a month ago.

608
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,876
A couple thousand from
the vacation fund.

609
00:44:50,251 --> 00:44:51,582
Stop, Ash.

610
00:44:56,391 --> 00:44:58,154
I was thinking...

611
00:44:59,394 --> 00:45:02,363
maybe this'll be the time
for us to get a place.

612
00:45:02,497 --> 00:45:04,556
You could cover that?

613
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:07,134
And maybe we don't rent.

614
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:10,604
Maybe we try and buy something
in the neighborhood.

615
00:45:11,005 --> 00:45:13,496
Nothing too big, just...

616
00:45:16,244 --> 00:45:18,508
I heard Aunt Treesey's
old place up in Covington...

617
00:45:18,613 --> 00:45:20,638
has been fixed up real nice.

618
00:45:23,184 --> 00:45:25,516
Like with wood floors and all.

619
00:45:28,122 --> 00:45:31,057
Ash, what's that ship right there?

620
00:45:31,426 --> 00:45:34,953
- Cable ship.
- And what's the gray one next to it?

621
00:45:35,063 --> 00:45:36,530
Military Sealift.

622
00:45:37,565 --> 00:45:38,827
Attagirl.

623
00:45:41,603 --> 00:45:42,570
You cold?

624
00:45:48,943 --> 00:45:50,706
- Dwight?
- What's up?

625
00:45:51,012 --> 00:45:53,378
We're gonna have to
search your vehicle. Sorry.

626
00:45:53,481 --> 00:45:54,709
Search? What the fuck?

627
00:45:54,816 --> 00:45:57,580
Open it, or I'm gonna shim the lock,
maybe damage your ride.

628
00:45:57,685 --> 00:45:59,744
You got no call to be doing me like this.

629
00:45:59,854 --> 00:46:03,085
- No call and no damn warrant.
- You drive onto a D.O.C. facility...

630
00:46:03,191 --> 00:46:05,284
you acknowledge the vehicle's
subject to search.

631
00:46:05,393 --> 00:46:07,327
Where's the key, Dwight?

632
00:46:18,006 --> 00:46:20,099
He's gonna be back
from lunch any minute, Zig.

633
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:22,108
You hear me? He sees you on that thing...

634
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:24,974
he's gonna break you down
and sell you for parts.

635
00:46:51,773 --> 00:46:53,138
Here it be.

636
00:46:54,575 --> 00:46:56,702
You all planted that shit.

637
00:46:56,811 --> 00:46:58,802
You fucking know you did.

638
00:47:14,595 --> 00:47:17,359
- What's with the whistle squad?
- It's for us.

639
00:47:17,465 --> 00:47:19,990
They marked us the moment
we stepped out of the car.

640
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:22,296
- That's him.
- That's Horseface?

641
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:25,867
- How did he get the name?
- You need a close-up?

642
00:47:26,441 --> 00:47:27,806
Thomas Pakusa.

643
00:47:29,877 --> 00:47:31,845
We need to talk to you about something.

644
00:47:31,946 --> 00:47:33,038
What?

645
00:47:36,384 --> 00:47:39,376
You were working the Atlantic Light
when it docked, right?

646
00:47:39,487 --> 00:47:40,647
If you say so.

647
00:47:40,755 --> 00:47:42,814
You remember that container
that came off that day?

648
00:47:42,924 --> 00:47:45,085
- With all the dead girls.
- No.

649
00:47:45,193 --> 00:47:47,559
You don't remember
all them dead girls in a can?

650
00:47:47,662 --> 00:47:49,095
Come on, Horse.

651
00:47:49,197 --> 00:47:51,392
I remember when you found them all
in the stacks.

652
00:47:51,499 --> 00:47:53,933
I don't remember
they came off the Atlantic Light.

653
00:47:54,035 --> 00:47:56,765
Let's take a ride downtown,
clear this mess up.

654
00:47:56,871 --> 00:47:57,895
No.

655
00:48:00,308 --> 00:48:01,775
Get the fuck in the car.

656
00:48:01,876 --> 00:48:04,310
- Am I locked up?
- Get in the damn car.

657
00:48:04,412 --> 00:48:06,505
You want me in that car,
you need to lock me up.

658
00:48:06,614 --> 00:48:09,447
If that's the way it'll be,
I wanna talk to my shop steward...

659
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:12,041
and he can have an IBS lawyer go with me.

660
00:48:16,824 --> 00:48:18,086
Dad, what--

661
00:48:18,493 --> 00:48:20,757
Jesus, Pop, what's that for?

662
00:48:21,362 --> 00:48:22,727
Say cheese.

663
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:25,799
You pull another stunt like that, Zig,
I'll have your damn card.

664
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,097
I don't care who your mother is.
Get the fuck out of here!

665
00:48:35,076 --> 00:48:37,567
Kind of smart for a fat man, isn't he?

666
00:48:37,678 --> 00:48:39,009
All right.

667
00:48:54,962 --> 00:48:57,590
Goddamn it, Ziggy, you sick fuck.

668
00:48:57,832 --> 00:48:59,993
Get your dick out of my computer!

669
00:49:09,811 --> 00:49:12,075
Where are the detectives
who were first assigned?

670
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,479
Dead. To me, anyway.

671
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:19,075
I shipped them humps back to Burrell
as fast as I could.

672
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:34,834
What kept you?

673
00:49:35,536 --> 00:49:37,697
That's the beautiful thing
about this department.

674
00:49:37,805 --> 00:49:40,501
Every brain-dead
somehow manages to land on his feet.

675
00:49:40,608 --> 00:49:42,508
- How's it hanging, Prez?
- How're you doing?

676
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:43,872
I'm all right.

677
00:49:43,978 --> 00:49:46,310
Where's Lester? We got him, too, right?

678
00:49:46,647 --> 00:49:48,945
He was out on the street
today with Homicide...

679
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:51,416
but Rawls promised to give him
the bad news tomorrow.

680
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:52,679
Not McNulty though.

681
00:49:52,787 --> 00:49:55,312
McNulty they really hate,
not that I blame them.

682
00:49:55,423 --> 00:49:57,482
You, of course,
have Roland for the duration.

683
00:49:57,592 --> 00:50:00,789
Anyone else from the southeastern
you need, you got.

684
00:50:03,631 --> 00:50:05,656
I'll leave you to it, then.

685
00:50:08,135 --> 00:50:11,662
Carver's in the southeast, now.
I think he's got Sector Two.

686
00:50:11,772 --> 00:50:14,297
It'd be great to have Carver on this, right?

687
00:50:14,408 --> 00:50:15,739
On what?

688
00:50:15,843 --> 00:50:19,040
We don't even know what the hell
we're supposed to be chasing here.

689
00:50:19,146 --> 00:50:21,740
No offense to your father-in-law,
but it's real thin.

690
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:25,478
We're here, right? Whatever happens,
we run with the program for a few weeks.

691
00:50:25,586 --> 00:50:27,645
Maybe make a drug case or two
down by the port.

692
00:50:27,755 --> 00:50:29,916
Beats the hell out of E.C.U. anyway.

693
00:50:35,029 --> 00:50:37,998
Him and this lady have this daughter.
The daughter's born a mute.

694
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:40,567
The wife doesn't like that at all,
so she breaks out.

695
00:50:40,668 --> 00:50:43,262
So this guy's raising his daughter,
she has her period...

696
00:50:43,371 --> 00:50:46,067
freaks out, goes to him,
he thinks she was raped--

697
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:47,401
Jackpot.

698
00:50:48,743 --> 00:50:51,507
That's about $10 worth
of bulk metal right there.

699
00:50:51,612 --> 00:50:54,638
We just have to haul it down
to the scrap yard and we're good.

700
00:50:54,749 --> 00:50:56,717
We'll break our fucking backs on this thing.

701
00:50:56,817 --> 00:51:00,275
Keep your eye to the ground, okay?
I'm schooling you.

702
00:51:00,388 --> 00:51:01,582
Okay?

703
00:51:02,156 --> 00:51:03,885
This is good, right here.

704
00:51:04,892 --> 00:51:06,689
This is $10 right here.

705
00:51:09,697 --> 00:51:11,221
Snitching Bubs.

706
00:51:17,772 --> 00:51:19,535
You be asking for me?

707
00:52:07,855 --> 00:52:11,916
These headphones are great.
I'm gonna use them at the gym. Thanks.

708
00:52:15,096 --> 00:52:18,657
- You hear the boys?
- No, it's quiet up there.

709
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,295
A little too quiet.

710
00:52:21,402 --> 00:52:23,893
That means they're probably
playing video games.

711
00:52:24,005 --> 00:52:25,836
Or with a book of matches.

712
00:52:27,942 --> 00:52:31,378
So, did you have a lawyer
look at the papers yet?

713
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,205
I did.

714
00:52:35,983 --> 00:52:38,281
- And?
- He says I shouldn't sign it.

715
00:52:39,754 --> 00:52:41,722
Says I'm giving away too much.

716
00:52:42,456 --> 00:52:44,287
I would never, under any circumstances...

717
00:52:44,392 --> 00:52:47,122
pay that kind of support and alimony
if we went to court.

718
00:52:47,261 --> 00:52:48,694
That's what he says?

719
00:53:00,307 --> 00:53:02,104
Signed and notarized.

720
00:53:06,013 --> 00:53:08,379
I don't wanna argue about the money.

721
00:53:08,749 --> 00:53:10,774
I wanna get back together.

722
00:53:19,427 --> 00:53:20,394
Yeah.

723
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:29,329
Yo, String, I was subtle with that.

724
00:53:30,237 --> 00:53:33,604
...has led to drug distribution charges
against three inmates...

725
00:53:33,707 --> 00:53:35,766
one who was, himself, incapacitated...

726
00:53:35,876 --> 00:53:38,743
by the tainted narcotics
and the correctional officer...

727
00:53:38,846 --> 00:53:39,835
a 10-year veteran.

728
00:53:39,947 --> 00:53:42,415
I've been instructed
by the Corrections Commissioner...

729
00:53:42,516 --> 00:53:44,882
and the State Public Safety Secretary...

730
00:53:45,052 --> 00:53:48,180
to announce that the maximum penalties...

731
00:53:48,322 --> 00:53:50,722
will be sought against this officer...

732
00:53:50,925 --> 00:53:53,223
I got a midterm. I got to study.

733
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:22,077
- So this is their joint?
- What's the plan?

734
00:54:22,556 --> 00:54:26,356
Time to make it clear to these people
that we're not gonna go away.

735
00:54:49,283 --> 00:54:51,877
You ain't gonna play
that country shit, right?

736
00:54:52,086 --> 00:54:54,145
I hate that country shit.

737
00:54:55,089 --> 00:54:59,423
Not even Ray Charles
can save that mess for me.

738
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:04,058
No, sir.

739
00:55:14,575 --> 00:55:18,739
Big Daddy Lipscomb was right tackle.
Your brain's gone to shit, Jessy.

740
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:20,708
Left tackle.

741
00:55:20,915 --> 00:55:24,351
You was too busy pissing in your drawers
to learn left from right.

742
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:27,852
Take your ass down to Schula's Steakhouse
and get an education.

743
00:55:27,955 --> 00:55:29,149
Darling.

744
00:55:33,727 --> 00:55:34,819
What's the deal?

745
00:55:34,929 --> 00:55:38,660
Just dropping in for one or two
and then we take ourselves out of here.

746
00:55:38,766 --> 00:55:40,700
How about you?

747
00:55:41,068 --> 00:55:42,899
I'm leaving after this one.

748
00:55:54,148 --> 00:55:57,345
You guys Port Police?
I don't recognize either one of you.

749
00:55:57,851 --> 00:56:00,445
- City Homicide.
- Homicide?

750
00:56:00,554 --> 00:56:03,421
- Who got killed?
- Those dead girls in the can.

751
00:56:04,158 --> 00:56:07,753
That was an accident.
That was a fucking accident.

752
00:56:08,062 --> 00:56:10,155
That's what I heard, anyway.

753
00:56:15,803 --> 00:56:17,270
Excuse me.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
