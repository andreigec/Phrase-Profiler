1
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:39,240
No, Bubs.

2
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,130
I mean, there's gotta be rules
or else things get fucked up.

3
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,784
Ain't no rules
for dope fiends.

4
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:49,102
When the police got you shackled up,
you make a move, right?

5
00:01:49,114 --> 00:01:50,021
You help yourself out.

6
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:52,037
But you just start
snitchin' for no reason...

7
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:52,976
it doesn't make no...

8
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:54,989
Let me track this.

9
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:58,094
You hypopulatin' that you can
tattle-tale when you locked up

10
00:01:58,102 --> 00:02:00,229
but you can't do it
straight up for the money?

11
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:02,560
I mean, no offense, son, but...

12
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:05,657
that some weak-ass thinkin'.
You equivocatin' like a motherfuck.

13
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:10,289
- Okay, so a snitch is a snitch, right?
- There you go.

14
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:11,615
So why be one, man?

15
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,656
I mean, we gettin'
by with our capers.

16
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:15,861
We gettin' by out here
every damn day

17
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:18,278
rippin' and runnin' and ain't
got shit to show for it.

18
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:20,940
It's part of being a soldier?

19
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:23,049
I mean, that's true, right,
that's what you says.

20
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,266
That was 'fore I put all
this mileage on these feet.

21
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:27,365
You wait, you wait,
till you ain't a pup no more,

22
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:29,665
see if you ain't lookin'
for somethin' a little more,

23
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,436
a little more steady
for your ownself.

24
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:37,745
What the fuck?
You gettin' ill already.

25
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:39,728
It's not even past morning.

26
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,498
I'm cool, man.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

27
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:46,223
Look, we hook up with
my girl Kima, we get paid

28
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:47,291
you gonna be better.

29
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,517
Fuck that, Bubs, alright?
I'm not a fuckin' snitch.

30
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,464
You know...

31
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:53,365
I could argue the other side.

32
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:56,567
Say that if you drop dime
to duck a charge, then you a snitch.

33
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:59,019
You do it as a living,
you a professional.

34
00:03:03,145 --> 00:03:04,611
Hold up, hold up,
hold up, hold up.

35
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:07,503
You see that, that ladder right there.
Just like old times, man.

36
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:10,171
I'll be the bad guy,
you be the lone ranger.

37
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:11,098
Leave that man be.

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,432
We get paid more
hooking up to my girl.

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,494
But that's cash money
right there.

40
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,692
With the white man,
I best be the bad guy.

41
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:25,918
That way he ain't confused.

42
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:28,262
Alright, meet me in the alley.

43
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:30,323
Fuck.

44
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:37,902
Yo, Mister.

45
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:38,969
Yo.

46
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,961
Throw down your wallet, or I'm
a jerk this ladder right out.

47
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:42,304
What?

48
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:42,738
No, no!

49
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,274
I'm a poor man
who ain't playin'.

50
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,644
Throw down
the got-damn money.

51
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:46,180
Please, no.

52
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:50,434
Leave that man alone.

53
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:01,973
Thank you.

54
00:04:03,238 --> 00:04:04,646
He's crazy, man.

55
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:05,995
What's that guy doing?

56
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:07,274
Oh, shit.

57
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:09,526
- Here, here.
- I can't, I can't.

58
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:11,051
No, you saved my ass.

59
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:13,573
It's appreciated you know.

60
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,785
Yo, Bubs.
You won't fuckin' believe this.

61
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:28,427
Bubs?

62
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:05,495
Straight and True

63
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,299
<i>Dennis, you up?</i>

64
00:06:20,674 --> 00:06:21,469
<i>Dennis?</i>

65
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:25,105
Mee-maw, hey.

66
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:27,827
Guess you're not
workin' today, huh?

67
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:29,915
I'm workin' nights now.

68
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:31,818
At a bar.

69
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:33,719
Workin' the door.

70
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:36,464
You know, it's just...

71
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:40,018
just 'til I find
somethin' a little bit better.

72
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:41,977
Reminds me.

73
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,851
Your friend called
again this morning.

74
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,585
She said for you
to remember your appointment.

75
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,722
Says there's a job in it,
if you still lookin'.

76
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:15,887
So, Marlo, right?

77
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:18,163
He got this one boy
watchin' his back

78
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,676
name be Chris Partlow.

79
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:20,966
Barlow with a "b"?

80
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,418
Part, like white people
got in their hair.

81
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:25,354
And low, like
a low-bottom dope fiend.

82
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,526
- Partlow.
- Yeah, what I said.

83
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:29,461
So, he's Marlo's muscle?

84
00:07:30,353 --> 00:07:31,045
So...

85
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:39,004
how much is that worth?

86
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,262
Five, if I can
work up a photo id.

87
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,233
The boy, Fruit, he used that.

88
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:49,704
Fruit who runs
one of Marlo's corners?

89
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:50,853
Careful, it's got prints.

90
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,756
Prints, huh?

91
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:54,361
Look at you, gettin' all
C.S.I. on me and shit.

92
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:57,188
A burner with prints.
That's gotta mean cash money, right?

93
00:07:58,302 --> 00:08:01,625
If I can pull a print, get Fruit id'd,
I can go to ten.

94
00:08:05,074 --> 00:08:07,385
An' if I show you where
Marlo hides his Mercedes.

95
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:09,144
The Benz would go for 15.

96
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:12,965
You don't know it, but these
are hard times in a hard land.

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,384
You killin' me out here, girl.

98
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:15,498
A- ight.

99
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:17,129
25 for the Benz.

100
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:20,351
You good peoples.

101
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,958
So let's total up

102
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,785
we at 40, right?

103
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:30,251
Here.

104
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:31,400
Bank that for me.

105
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:32,210
Bank it?

106
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:33,301
For what?

107
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:34,873
Got me a plan, girl.

108
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:36,656
The hoppers out here

109
00:08:37,254 --> 00:08:40,852
they only be wearin' them big white shirts
a couple of times 'fore they chuck 'em.

110
00:08:40,863 --> 00:08:43,163
So I'm thinkin' while I'm out
here workin' for y'all

111
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:45,591
I'ma get my ends up, sell 'em
shirts on the corners.

112
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:47,385
I'll make my nut
comin' an' goin'.

113
00:09:06,467 --> 00:09:09,118
Truthfully, I don't know
what more you could have done.

114
00:09:09,247 --> 00:09:10,291
Charlie's right, boss.

115
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:11,804
You tried.

116
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:14,205
Fuckin' hoodleheads
won't cooperate.

117
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:16,656
Here you are, giving 'em
their own block or two

118
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,615
offering them a place
to sell drugs in peace

119
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,093
and do they even
fuckin' listen?

120
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:22,178
It's a damn shame, too,
'cause if it worked

121
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:24,524
you mighta had a positive
effect on the community.

122
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,670
<i>Shift commander
call the front desk. </i>

123
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,213
You guys are some
lying sacks of shit.

124
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:32,779
I'm sayin', sir...

125
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:35,452
I'm guessin' that you

126
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:38,767
have some thoughts on where
we should go from here.

127
00:09:39,881 --> 00:09:43,134
Well, sir, we were thinkin'
a modified zebra operation.

128
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,167
Jumpouts rotating from sector-to-sector,
combined with a zero tolerance approach.

129
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:49,270
We detail a couple
of men from each shift

130
00:09:49,481 --> 00:09:50,395
build a flex unit

131
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:52,847
double up on the head-knocking
and corner-clearing.

132
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:54,208
More of the same, you mean.

133
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:55,123
But better.

134
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:56,296
Better?

135
00:09:58,088 --> 00:09:59,085
Better than nothing.

136
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:24,863
Ah, fuck this bullshit already!

137
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:28,792
Man, they gave us 15 cases of legal

138
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:31,449
but they shorted us
on the colored bonds...

139
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:33,162
what's going on there?

140
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:39,038
I got this.

141
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:44,176
Officer.

142
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,745
Detective, String.

143
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:47,106
You remember?

144
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,545
Bird trial, detective McNulty.

145
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:51,645
You want something copied, man?

146
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:52,830
Search warrant?

147
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:54,073
Court papers?

148
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:55,877
Anything I do to help, you know?

149
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:57,777
I ain't seen you around the way.

150
00:10:58,376 --> 00:11:01,379
I'm not around the way no more.
You wanna find me, I'm right here.

151
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,385
Right here, huh?

152
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:07,557
This an' some real estate
I'm workin' on is all.

153
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:08,166
You know?

154
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:10,126
More than enough
to occupy me, really.

155
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:17,666
Say where you livin', man?

156
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:19,390
Where am I living?

157
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,654
Well, if you thinkin'
a comin' downtown

158
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,739
I got some condos about to come
on the line in eight months.

159
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:28,079
You say the word, I'ma hook you
up something nice down there

160
00:11:28,102 --> 00:11:28,912
by the hippodrome.

161
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:30,589
Loft apartments.

162
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:31,844
Real nice.

163
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,876
You disappoint me, String.

164
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,448
I had such fuckin' hopes for us.

165
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:42,263
Have a nice day, officer.

166
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,032
You see this shit?

167
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,809
Remember that kid
who got shot in the parking lot

168
00:11:56,821 --> 00:11:58,475
at Lake Clifton
a couple months back?

169
00:11:58,487 --> 00:11:59,308
Drug feud, right?

170
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:00,845
What about it?

171
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:03,683
Well, last night, they just
found the only eyewitness.

172
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:06,237
In an alleyway,
buncha holes in him.

173
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:06,835
And?

174
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:08,806
What do you mean, "and"?

175
00:12:09,404 --> 00:12:11,257
You're talking about
a state's witness.

176
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,101
You let a witness get killed in
a high-profile case like this

177
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:17,236
it says the city's
broke and can't be fixed.

178
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:20,120
Sounds like we found an issue.

179
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,640
Fuck the politics for a minute.

180
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,283
You know, this is something
we all need to be on the same page with.

181
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:27,536
I'm serious, Tony.

182
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:31,430
You let shit like this stand,
pretty soon you got nothing left.

183
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:33,706
You gonna go public
and bang the Mayor with it?

184
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:37,273
You gonna bang Burrell
and the state's attorney then?

185
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:39,208
I ain't gonna bang nobody.

186
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:41,742
Like I said, fuck the politics for once.

187
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:45,586
But there is a problem here
and I'm gonna do something to fix it.

188
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:48,331
You want your cape
and the little red underpants?

189
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:51,357
Or you stash that shit
in the phone booth?

190
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:55,135
I always wondered about that.

191
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:03,569
Man, I like a piece of that.

192
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:05,919
You'd like any piece at all.

193
00:13:06,424 --> 00:13:08,324
I think I'd like
a piece of your mother.

194
00:13:08,476 --> 00:13:09,896
Yo, stop fuckin' around!

195
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,292
He started that shit.

196
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:15,453
Yo, she got our boy
with his nose wide open.

197
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:19,969
He's stealing from us,
and she most likely the reason for it.

198
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:23,970
And y'all stay with the girl,
she'll soon enough show us the money.

199
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:25,870
Hey, where you goin'?

200
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:30,312
Yo, I got something I got to do.

201
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,353
You supposed to be here
on this shit with us.

202
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:35,485
Y'all stay with the girl,
I'll get back with y'all down the way.

203
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:36,571
Say what?

204
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:40,360
Yo, I made a date a while back.
Gotta keep it.

205
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:44,219
Man made a date, gotta keep it.

206
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:49,002
You find out he pussy-whipped
like this motherfuck over here.

207
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:52,967
Now, once again, from the data:

208
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:55,407
When are most cars stolen?

209
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:56,802
Sir, at night.

210
00:13:57,084 --> 00:14:02,281
And your unit, which I believe is
charged with deterring the theft of autos

211
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:04,193
when do you work?

212
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:07,325
The day shift, eight-to-four.
But sir, as I tried to explain...

213
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,714
Your position is clear:

214
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:17,210
You affect more arrests of car thieves
during the daylight than at night.

215
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,946
You see, our ears work.

216
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:20,803
We heard you.

217
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:22,621
But the question becomes:

218
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:24,580
Why the fuck can't you hear us?

219
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:26,949
- Sir, I don't...
- The Commissioner is attempting

220
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,171
to move this department
from the dark ages into the 21st century.

221
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:34,324
That means preventing crime
by relying on computer generated data

222
00:14:34,535 --> 00:14:37,397
not on your
fly-by-your-fucked-up-ass instinct.

223
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,039
Give me the auto theft numbers

224
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:43,585
for downtown parking lots
on friday nights.

225
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,599
Sir, I have to check that.

226
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,425
Where are we with the gun?

227
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,518
Colonel, I was made to understand

228
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,013
that recovering officer Dozerman's
lost weapon was a priority.

229
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:02,087
Oh, the gun, yes, we're on it, sir.
Making progress as we speak.

230
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:05,376
Lieutenant?

231
00:15:05,857 --> 00:15:08,695
Sir, I now understand that
prevention is the way to go

232
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:11,675
and will immediately change
our hours to reflect the data.

233
00:15:12,672 --> 00:15:13,493
Alright, Lieutenant.

234
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,801
Fecal gravity.

235
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:22,176
Hey, you beat on the right people
and the shit rolls down the hill.

236
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:40,851
Dennis is it?

237
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,188
Cutty works for me.

238
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:43,174
Cutty then.

239
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:49,903
So, um, it's just
gonna be us here?

240
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,261
You know...
I mean, Grace.

241
00:15:52,609 --> 00:15:54,169
Sister Grace
called on your behalf

242
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:56,327
but to my knowledge,
she didn't plan to be here.

243
00:15:58,005 --> 00:15:59,178
She's a beautiful woman.

244
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:03,843
A man might say things he didn't mean
to stand closer to a woman like that.

245
00:16:06,037 --> 00:16:08,277
You're in the job market
though, I understand.

246
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:10,342
A couple of questions.

247
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:13,521
You got a high school diploma?
G.E.D.?

248
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,122
Any work experience?

249
00:16:18,694 --> 00:16:23,677
I worked in a warehouse
for a couple of months back in like '86.

250
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:25,623
How do you see
the church helping you?

251
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:29,965
Maybe give me some jobs or...

252
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,915
put my name on a list or somethin'.
I dunno.

253
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,414
I should tell you up front,
we don't do like that here.

254
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:37,678
You want a job, you're gonna
have to work to get it.

255
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:39,574
We'll help.
But it's gonna be your sweat.

256
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:44,313
With that said, then, the first thing is to
get you enrolled in a G.E.D. program...

257
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:48,278
Look, I don't mean to put you out,
but this...

258
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:51,219
this ain't how I thought
it was gonna play.

259
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:04,174
Me, Oscar, a bunch of the guys,
we seen it.

260
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:06,872
Couldn't help it.

261
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,720
They practically ran right past us.

262
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:13,062
And the victim, the girl...
had a gun?

263
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:15,244
Whose side was she on?

264
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:19,363
Couldn't tell, it weren't
doin' slow motion.

265
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,126
Did any of them have a big scar?

266
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:27,944
Do you think you'd be able to recognize
any of them again if you saw them?

267
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:29,950
- Just Omar.
- So, you know Omar?

268
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:31,428
Omar came up 'round here.

269
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:35,498
That's good, bruiser, very good.

270
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:38,642
You do know Omar
has a scar, right?

271
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:39,216
He do?

272
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:43,879
I think we better go to my
office, put this down on paper.

273
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:44,442
Come on.

274
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:48,114
Officer.

275
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:50,706
Excuse me, officer.

276
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:55,381
Is this... North and Pulaski?

277
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:59,571
'Cause I could fucking swear
Dozerman was shot up at North and Pulaski.

278
00:18:00,635 --> 00:18:01,843
Wait, wait, lemme guess

279
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:05,162
the pursuit of your fellow
officer's service weapon

280
00:18:05,173 --> 00:18:06,651
has led you to this fine citizen.

281
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:10,293
Tell me, kind sir, do you know
the whereabouts of said officer's weapon?

282
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:11,830
I didn't think so.

283
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:14,000
Calls from the detention center.

284
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:20,076
Some kind souls begging to assist you
in your foundering investigation.

285
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:27,205
Lemme just grand jury my man here.
Lock in his story.

286
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:31,346
Now for the gun. Later for his story.
And that's your sergeant talking.

287
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,096
Yo, wipe your nose, yo.

288
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:55,099
- What the fuck...
- Oh shit!

289
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:00,953
Motherfucker, you scared the shit
out of us coming up like that.

290
00:19:01,246 --> 00:19:03,780
Shit do make you paranoid, yo.

291
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:05,844
G'head, nigga, hit this shit.

292
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:08,003
Naw, man, I gotta
drop urine tomorrow.

293
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,607
Yo, you worried about that?

294
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:12,483
Go 'head, nigga.

295
00:19:12,577 --> 00:19:14,994
- We got that covered.
- Oh, you got that covered.

296
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:16,096
What?

297
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:18,806
You think you're the only
motherfucker on parole?

298
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:23,237
- Yo, nigger, gimme that shit.
- There you go.

299
00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:34,456
A- ight.

300
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:36,333
What was her day?

301
00:19:36,603 --> 00:19:38,561
She caught a hack up
to Towsontown mall.

302
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:42,297
Hit two jewelry stores and
came back with bags from both.

303
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:44,514
By the time she
caught up with our boy

304
00:19:45,124 --> 00:19:47,458
she was wearin' one of them
shits around her neck.

305
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:49,136
Gave the other one to him.

306
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:51,177
You know, his an' hers, like.

307
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:52,800
Yeah, Cutty.

308
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:54,442
You was on that shit, man.

309
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:03,514
It's been a week, McNulty.

310
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:06,013
Either you got something
on Stringer or you don't.

311
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:09,790
He tried to sell me a condo.

312
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:13,540
Cocksucker.

313
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:18,338
Might as well join the Rotary.
Take up golf or someshit.

314
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:20,895
He's runnin' with the hounds

315
00:20:20,906 --> 00:20:22,990
though I'll bet his heart
is still with the fox.

316
00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:24,327
Stringer's out of the game?

317
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:27,037
Mr. Bell has become the bank.

318
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:29,066
The bank?

319
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:33,636
The bank plays it legit,
he generates a good bit of honest income.

320
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:38,387
But at the same time, his money finances
packages that he himself will never touch.

321
00:20:39,056 --> 00:20:40,334
He won't go near the street.

322
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:43,548
He's insulated from the every day
operations on the corners.

323
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:46,175
The money that comes back
is then laundered through

324
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:49,471
enough straight business investments
that there's no way to trace it.

325
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:51,935
A player gets to that point,
there ain't no way

326
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:54,668
in hell a working police
is going to tie a can to his tail.

327
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:56,445
Oh, man.

328
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,729
So, Kintel Williamson,
the prince of Pimlico.

329
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,134
Where we at on this mope?

330
00:21:03,342 --> 00:21:05,465
DNR's on a couple of payphones.

331
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:24,575
That got it?

332
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:35,739
Alright.

333
00:21:37,358 --> 00:21:38,754
You gonna help or what, boy?

334
00:21:39,376 --> 00:21:41,252
Might as well not
even take a whistle

335
00:21:41,264 --> 00:21:43,751
if all I'm doin' is
standin' in the fuckin' alley!

336
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,956
Back's where you belong.

337
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:50,175
That'a way I ain't got to be worryin'
'bout gettin' my damn head blown off

338
00:21:50,187 --> 00:21:51,606
'cause you all scared and shit.

339
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:53,002
Enough!

340
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,104
You all hear me, I said enough?!

341
00:21:57,973 --> 00:22:00,694
Come over and put some pumpkin
balls in this shotgun, man.

342
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:01,679
Kimmy!

343
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:10,156
Both of y'all learn to live
with it or y'all out, man.

344
00:22:17,015 --> 00:22:18,657
Now, this time
we gonna do it right.

345
00:22:18,716 --> 00:22:19,455
Ya all feel me?

346
00:22:21,026 --> 00:22:23,455
Boss, you gotta let this go.
It ain't gonna work.

347
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:25,930
You said it in comstat:
Shit rolls down.

348
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:29,429
Now, we tried to talk to all the hoppers,
what the hell can they do about anything?

349
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:31,322
We need to bring it to the dealers.

350
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:33,656
Sergeant.

351
00:22:36,058 --> 00:22:37,037
I need a list of names

352
00:22:37,048 --> 00:22:39,213
of all the mid-level dealers
running my corners.

353
00:22:41,224 --> 00:22:41,729
Sir?

354
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:45,337
You're my D.E.U. Sergeant, right?
I need a list of names.

355
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:48,610
Maybe narcotics downtown has
something like that, I dunno.

356
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:51,859
We're knocking heads, taking bodies.

357
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,824
I didn't know I was supposed
to be doin' a census or nothing.

358
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:02,413
Hey, yo, miss. Miss?

359
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:03,973
Where the peepot at?

360
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:04,865
Thanks.

361
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:06,167
Come on, this way.

362
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,916
Yo, my man you need
to drop a negative.

363
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:16,878
Five dollars.

364
00:23:17,781 --> 00:23:19,346
Motherfucker, they was just two.

365
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:22,619
You try findin' clean piss in Baltimore.
Five a go.

366
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:27,323
Yo, how I know it's clean?

367
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:29,106
I get mine from day care...

368
00:23:34,036 --> 00:23:37,449
I need you to put the chicken
in the oven at 375.

369
00:23:37,778 --> 00:23:39,170
Yes, and after you've done that

370
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:41,223
I need you to help me
put your sister down...

371
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:42,103
Excuse me, miss.

372
00:23:43,687 --> 00:23:45,129
Put your thumb on the scanner.

373
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,729
Hold on a second.

374
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:53,517
What's your name?

375
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:55,770
Wise, Dennis Wise.

376
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,866
Take one of those.
Go around the corner to the second door.

377
00:24:00,118 --> 00:24:01,467
No, you can not go outside.

378
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:04,071
Are you listening
to what I'm saying?

379
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,276
That's all we got
on the Westside dealers.

380
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:38,807
George...

381
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:41,012
I'm lookin' at a sprinklin'
of rap sheets here.

382
00:24:41,153 --> 00:24:42,932
You tellin' me nobody
in this department

383
00:24:42,956 --> 00:24:45,243
knows who controls the West
Baltimore corners anymore?

384
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:47,308
Hey, Rawls has my people
doing street rips.

385
00:24:47,712 --> 00:24:50,434
You want up-to-date info,
you should try the intelligence unit.

386
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:53,529
- Shit, they sent me to you, George.
- What the fuck can I tell you?

387
00:24:53,632 --> 00:24:54,887
With all the street work

388
00:24:55,052 --> 00:24:57,445
there ain't nobody left
doin' high-end drug stuff.

389
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:02,145
From what I'm hearing

390
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,749
the guy comes in of his own accord

391
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:06,904
and he gets betrayed by us.

392
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:09,590
Protection in this city

393
00:25:09,837 --> 00:25:11,854
amounts to nothing
more than getting dumped

394
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:14,282
in a fleabag joint on route 40
and calling it a plan.

395
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:16,531
No monitoring, no assistance.

396
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:19,933
Nothing just a bundle of
clothes and a toothbrush.

397
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:21,610
Jesus.

398
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:23,299
No way to treat a cooperator.

399
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:26,475
I know someone could get a lot of mileage
out of this with the press.

400
00:25:26,498 --> 00:25:28,586
But fuck that, right?
Because if I go that way

401
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,885
then everyone gets defensive
and nothing gets fixed.

402
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:32,715
I'm coming to you
with this straight-up.

403
00:25:32,844 --> 00:25:33,384
Agreed.

404
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:35,642
Where do we stand on this?

405
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:37,883
You've already called
for a meeting on this

406
00:25:37,906 --> 00:25:40,334
with the State's Attorney
and the Police Commissioner.

407
00:25:41,261 --> 00:25:43,197
It's penciled in
for next wednesday.

408
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:45,737
No, no, Tommy's right on this,
we need to act quickly.

409
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:48,071
I'm glad you
came to us with this.

410
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,112
I'll light a fire, believe me.

411
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:52,153
Thanks.

412
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,170
You will keep me
in the loop on this?

413
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,777
Absolutely, Councilman.

414
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:18,218
Hey, slow up, girlfriend,
we need to talk for a minute.

415
00:26:18,254 --> 00:26:19,050
Yeah, sweet thin'.

416
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:19,708
We met before?

417
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,057
No, baby, but that can happen.

418
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:24,095
- We ain't met, excuse me.
- Hey, it's just talk, baby.

419
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,116
Get the fuck out, boy.

420
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,963
Look, girl, all we need
for you to do is talk...

421
00:26:27,975 --> 00:26:29,500
Is you deaf or just stone stupid?

422
00:26:29,511 --> 00:26:30,637
Hold on, girl...

423
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:36,643
Now, we gonna talk.

424
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:44,674
How the fuck

425
00:26:45,518 --> 00:26:46,973
is this little runt of a unit

426
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:49,284
holding all this
drug intelligence?

427
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:51,817
I made the rounds
down at headquarters

428
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,011
came up with Jack,
and you're holding all this?

429
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:57,971
Well, you run a couple wiretaps,
you fill up a file cabinet pretty fast.

430
00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:00,129
This is great, thanks.

431
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:04,302
Oh, shit!

432
00:27:05,698 --> 00:27:07,129
Goddamnit.

433
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:11,023
I heard this was where you landed.

434
00:27:11,657 --> 00:27:12,783
This pretty boy?

435
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:15,119
I broke his ass in.

436
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:18,778
I wrote more on I.I.D. complaints
on bushy top here

437
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,397
than on the whole
goddamn squad.

438
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:21,899
That is 'til he scuffed himself up.

439
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:23,834
Now where you at, McNulty?

440
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:26,637
1911 South Clinton Street,
first floor.

441
00:27:27,217 --> 00:27:28,027
There you go.

442
00:27:33,702 --> 00:27:35,333
I know you got to keep him close

443
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:36,459
but still

444
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:38,946
some good goddamn
police right here.

445
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,956
So what brings you to our shop?

446
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:44,513
I'm tryin' to find out
who running my corners.

447
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:49,968
My own D.E.U. is just about street rips
and headquarters wadn't no help neither.

448
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:52,776
Y'all saved my ass, though.

449
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:55,204
You tell him about your boy...
Marlo ?

450
00:27:55,427 --> 00:27:56,495
It's in the files

451
00:27:56,894 --> 00:27:59,286
along with every other
mid-level player we know.

452
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:00,800
You don't mind me asking?

453
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,212
What're you gonna do
with all that, Major?

454
00:28:04,022 --> 00:28:04,585
Well...

455
00:28:06,731 --> 00:28:08,397
round up these young men

456
00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:11,517
and put a little comstat
on they ass.

457
00:28:13,023 --> 00:28:14,536
Gentlemen. Ma'am.

458
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,401
Bushy top.

459
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:21,832
Bushy top?

460
00:28:30,129 --> 00:28:31,482
<i>Call to order and shit. </i>

461
00:28:31,618 --> 00:28:34,606
Chair recognize the esteemed rep.
of the Veronica Avenue boys.

462
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,972
Alright, look, we done
talked this shit to death. A-ight?

463
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:40,048
When we gonna vote?

464
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:41,937
Rick do have a point.

465
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:42,881
A- ight, then.

466
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:45,016
All those in favor
of goin' together

467
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:47,831
so we can get the best
discount on a New York package

468
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:49,215
raise up.

469
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,297
A- ight then.

470
00:29:02,496 --> 00:29:03,212
There it is.

471
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,962
Look like we gonna
make more money...

472
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:06,900
together.

473
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:09,516
Got to say I'm proud
of y'all for puttin' aside

474
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:12,155
petty grievances an'
puttin' this thing together.

475
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:14,555
For a cold-ass
crew of gangsters

476
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:16,562
y'all carried it like
republicans an' shit.

477
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:20,093
Yo, remember, man,
talk this shit up when you hit them bricks.

478
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,834
Best way to get more
involved is to tell people

479
00:29:22,857 --> 00:29:25,016
about the benefits
of this here thing.

480
00:29:25,227 --> 00:29:27,432
No beefing. No drama.
Just business.

481
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:30,376
Anybody got a problem
with anybody else here

482
00:29:30,775 --> 00:29:31,918
we bring it to the group.

483
00:29:32,352 --> 00:29:33,983
We ain't gotta take it
to the streets.

484
00:29:36,094 --> 00:29:36,704
A- ight.

485
00:29:38,088 --> 00:29:38,722
Let's do it.

486
00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:43,462
Yo.

487
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:47,861
Motherfucker, what is that?

488
00:29:48,178 --> 00:29:51,075
Them Robert rules say we gotta have
minutes for a meeting, right?

489
00:29:51,134 --> 00:29:52,002
These the minutes.

490
00:29:52,483 --> 00:29:56,421
Nigga, is you takin' notes on
a criminal fucking conspiracy.

491
00:29:56,574 --> 00:29:58,274
What the fuck
is you thinkin', man?

492
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:05,947
That's cool.

493
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:07,402
Dad, he's cheating.

494
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,076
Michael, take it easy
on your brother.

495
00:30:13,017 --> 00:30:15,445
How are you two gettin' along
with mom's new friend?

496
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,756
We call him Dennis,
he's not new.

497
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:20,113
Okay, how are you
doin' with him?

498
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:22,612
Mom said we can't talk
to you about family stuff.

499
00:30:22,894 --> 00:30:24,899
Dad, you goin' to the open house?

500
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:29,685
Yeah, I'll try, but I've been
real busy at work though.

501
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:30,999
New case an' all.

502
00:30:31,222 --> 00:30:33,295
Mom says you have to go, dad.

503
00:30:34,011 --> 00:30:36,322
Yeah, all the other kids'
fathers are gonna be there.

504
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:46,369
Get his legs.

505
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,642
Steal from us, motherfucker?

506
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:07,343
Get the ring, too, yo.

507
00:31:09,943 --> 00:31:11,046
Shit won't come off, yo.

508
00:31:11,984 --> 00:31:12,536
Drop him.

509
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:20,614
You know the man works for us.

510
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,684
You keep goin' at him like that

511
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:26,652
ain't gonna be nothing left of
him to make right what he owes.

512
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:46,594
Bitch got to pay.

513
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:49,397
Hey, yo, check his pockets, yo.

514
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:56,823
- That's mine, yo.
- Get the fuck off...

515
00:32:02,324 --> 00:32:03,384
<i>... to security. </i>

516
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:04,221
Was' up, baby.

517
00:32:14,572 --> 00:32:16,038
Yo, man, I been in here 26 months

518
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,385
an' you come pick me up
in a motherfuckin' Ford?

519
00:32:22,021 --> 00:32:23,147
I'm just fuckin' with you.

520
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:23,968
Was' up, baby?

521
00:32:24,684 --> 00:32:25,707
What up, man.

522
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:29,226
Man, I'm feeling real good
to be out of this motherfucker.

523
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:29,871
You know what?

524
00:32:29,895 --> 00:32:33,074
There's a sign on the other
side of this gate that say "never again".

525
00:32:33,261 --> 00:32:36,582
And that's the only fucking thin'
I'm gonna take with me from this place.

526
00:32:36,694 --> 00:32:38,759
First thin' first,
let's get you lookin' right.

527
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,685
You know what I mean?

528
00:32:39,697 --> 00:32:40,823
Oh, you got my shit.

529
00:32:42,747 --> 00:32:43,592
Good looking, baby.

530
00:32:56,878 --> 00:32:58,320
Start with sector one.

531
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:01,183
Bring as many as you can
down to the Vincent Street area

532
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:02,086
by the end of shift.

533
00:33:02,238 --> 00:33:04,068
Don't use your wagons.

534
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:06,375
Bring as many as
you can in your cars.

535
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,311
The hoppers wouldn't listen.

536
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:10,094
What makes you think
these guys will?

537
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:11,912
These are...

538
00:33:12,932 --> 00:33:14,493
the lieutenants running the corners

539
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:17,489
and I personally feel their pain.

540
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:20,879
Now, middle-management
means that you have

541
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:24,727
just enough responsibility
that you got to listen when people talk

542
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,081
and not so much

543
00:33:27,914 --> 00:33:30,717
that you can tell anybody
to go fuck themselves.

544
00:33:57,382 --> 00:33:58,919
Look, my major just wants to talk.

545
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:00,936
That's all, promise.

546
00:34:02,086 --> 00:34:03,353
We'll bring you right back.

547
00:34:03,763 --> 00:34:04,760
Ain't gonna happen.

548
00:34:07,716 --> 00:34:08,807
The fuck you say?

549
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,362
What the fuck you mean
it ain't going to happen?

550
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,673
Let me tell you something,
motherfucker.

551
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:16,503
We got orders to bring
your sorry ass down

552
00:34:16,526 --> 00:34:18,157
the way for a sit down
with our boss.

553
00:34:18,274 --> 00:34:20,547
Now we're prepared
to take you with us right now.

554
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,506
We can either do this
the easy way or...

555
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:23,785
<i>braindead fucks... </i>

556
00:34:26,002 --> 00:34:26,577
<i>Hello. </i>

557
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:27,797
Prez, it's me.

558
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,061
I think we got
a little situation here.

559
00:34:30,493 --> 00:34:32,323
Stay with me, ten-six...

560
00:34:32,346 --> 00:34:34,446
Major wants the dickhead,
he gotta go.

561
00:34:37,296 --> 00:34:38,763
I think he gets a pass this time.

562
00:34:39,314 --> 00:34:40,111
You sure?

563
00:34:40,276 --> 00:34:42,289
I mean, you want, he goes.

564
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:43,778
Another time, Herc.

565
00:34:45,327 --> 00:34:46,828
We're on the Major's clock here.

566
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:54,078
Don't forget the face, cocksucker,
there's gonna be a tomorrow.

567
00:34:59,928 --> 00:35:01,587
<i>You need me to call dispatch?</i>

568
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:02,907
No, it's okay.

569
00:35:03,564 --> 00:35:04,549
I'll tell you later.

570
00:35:04,943 --> 00:35:07,712
I say we get the troops,
and fuck these assholes up.

571
00:35:24,531 --> 00:35:25,740
Come on, let's go again.

572
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:27,288
C'mon, Tommy, it's just a game.

573
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:31,425
Look, sounds like you
got what you want, anyway.

574
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,161
From the Mayor, I mean.

575
00:35:33,243 --> 00:35:35,320
Yeah, well, he's played me before

576
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:37,396
but so help me

577
00:35:37,865 --> 00:35:39,405
if he farts around on this

578
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,044
I'm going after him. Big time.

579
00:35:42,994 --> 00:35:43,663
For real?

580
00:35:44,062 --> 00:35:45,211
Trust me on this.

581
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:47,323
He keeps ducking me

582
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:50,079
I'm going to fuck him good.

583
00:35:52,753 --> 00:35:53,762
That's the good part.

584
00:35:54,876 --> 00:35:56,214
It's what I call the carrot.

585
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:59,099
Now you move your people
into any designated area

586
00:35:59,123 --> 00:35:59,862
I told you about

587
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:03,084
and you have immunity from
arrest and prosecution.

588
00:36:03,472 --> 00:36:04,844
You're free to make your drops

589
00:36:04,961 --> 00:36:06,252
collect what needs collectin'

590
00:36:06,674 --> 00:36:07,976
and won't nobody bother you.

591
00:36:08,422 --> 00:36:09,689
You've got my word on it.

592
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,045
What do you get out of this?

593
00:36:13,902 --> 00:36:15,075
That's a fair question.

594
00:36:15,521 --> 00:36:18,359
I want to salvage what's still
worth salvagin' in my district.

595
00:36:18,547 --> 00:36:21,245
And I can't do that with a bunch
of young hoppers runnin' around

596
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:23,060
scarin' the hell
out of the decent people.

597
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:26,262
Now, these kids ain't gonna listen to me,
but they will listen to y'all.

598
00:36:26,344 --> 00:36:28,690
Now, you tell them to move
down here and set-up shop

599
00:36:28,714 --> 00:36:29,394
and they will.

600
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:31,048
So the way I got it figured

601
00:36:31,682 --> 00:36:34,913
I motivate you,
and you motivate them.

602
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,072
Naw, this a trap.

603
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:38,808
No, you check out the spot.

604
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:42,479
There ain't no cameras,
ain't no microphones, nothing.

605
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:46,160
Any cops you see going to be
down right on the perimeter.

606
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,447
Just to make sure
there's no violence.

607
00:36:49,362 --> 00:36:50,230
And you watch

608
00:36:50,993 --> 00:36:53,046
you see if it don't
work out the way I say.

609
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:56,579
Nothin' personal
against you, chief, but...

610
00:36:57,987 --> 00:36:59,171
what happens if we buck?

611
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,963
You remember the carrot, right?

612
00:37:04,465 --> 00:37:06,236
Well, if you choose
the stick instead

613
00:37:06,952 --> 00:37:09,709
you gonna feel that stick like
you ain't never felt before.

614
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:13,357
We gonna indict
every corner, every day.

615
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,439
I've got over 200 sworn
personnel and I plan to free up

616
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:19,782
every one of them to knock every
one of you y'all down they can.

617
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,281
If you're on a corner in my district

618
00:37:22,738 --> 00:37:24,240
it ain't gonna be about no humble

619
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:27,169
it ain't gonna be about
no loitering charge, nothing like that.

620
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,735
There gonna be some biblical
shit happening to you on the way

621
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,093
to that motherfuckin' jail wagon.
You understand me?

622
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:34,989
And while you're
buckin' the new system,

623
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:37,136
the smart ones among you,
gonna be down here

624
00:37:37,582 --> 00:37:38,520
makin' money

625
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,010
hand over fist.

626
00:37:42,368 --> 00:37:43,318
So, think it over.

627
00:37:44,573 --> 00:37:46,094
But I swear to god, come monday

628
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,957
your world and mine
ain't gonna be the same.

629
00:37:58,394 --> 00:38:01,045
I thought you said these
goddamn houses were vacant.

630
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,075
We musta missed her.

631
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:05,984
There's one more thing
I gotta do then.

632
00:38:23,241 --> 00:38:26,760
Little Man, up on "b" tier,
one of his boys in the dormitory

633
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:31,263
his brother's tight with the girlfriend
of the boy that shot that poh-leece.

634
00:38:31,873 --> 00:38:33,069
Little Man sayin'

635
00:38:33,832 --> 00:38:35,439
if you sprung the three of us

636
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:38,951
we could get her talkin',
you know, find the gun.

637
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:43,306
I'm hearin' the boy, Dink,
got that man's gun.

638
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:48,300
Now, I ain't sure yet if that
Dink be Dink Dink or Inky Dink

639
00:38:48,347 --> 00:38:49,555
or maybe Fat Dink.

640
00:38:50,517 --> 00:38:52,452
Then again,
it might be Flat Nose Dink.

641
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:53,485
No, wait

642
00:38:55,382 --> 00:38:56,801
that can't
be him, that Dink dead.

643
00:38:57,798 --> 00:38:59,534
Look, man, I can help you

644
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,479
but first you gotta get me out
from under these murder beefs.

645
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,109
How many murders we talkin'?

646
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:12,036
Look, man, do it have
to be the cop's gun?

647
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:15,145
'Cause if it's guns you want,
I can get you guns.

648
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:27,047
I remember this.

649
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:29,909
Sixth grade.
Mrs. Holley's science class.

650
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,842
Box lunches. Taste like shit.

651
00:39:33,534 --> 00:39:35,199
You got somethin'
so important, man

652
00:39:35,222 --> 00:39:37,134
you can't go through
the proper channels?

653
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:37,756
Well, no.

654
00:39:39,035 --> 00:39:39,880
I don't know.

655
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,293
I just figured if
I told anybody but you

656
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:45,018
you might think
I'm ridin' the rock.

657
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,188
What makes me think you ain't?

658
00:39:48,372 --> 00:39:50,073
Yeah, right.
That's a good point.

659
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:53,780
Look, today, me,
Tuckie, Little Mikey

660
00:39:54,707 --> 00:39:55,610
man, we all...

661
00:39:55,622 --> 00:39:57,592
A bunch of us got
scooped up by the police.

662
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,193
Well, you shouldn't sell drugs.

663
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:10,085
Alright, alright.

664
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,991
Nah see, they didn't
take us to the station.

665
00:40:14,003 --> 00:40:16,337
They took us down to the
bottom of Vincent Street

666
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,906
where all the houses is boarded
up, and they let us out.

667
00:40:18,964 --> 00:40:20,618
And then, on top of all of that

668
00:40:20,642 --> 00:40:22,835
like the whole while they
were being all like...

669
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:26,130
decent and shit,
you know that fucked me up.

670
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,130
And then the police chief,
he come out.

671
00:40:30,517 --> 00:40:32,132
And this is the crazy part

672
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:35,311
he say that he got it set up
so that we could sell stuff

673
00:40:36,097 --> 00:40:39,053
in certain spots,
and the police won't bother us.

674
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:45,599
I know, I know. It's fucked up,
but I just thought you should know.

675
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:49,945
That's it?

676
00:40:50,344 --> 00:40:52,866
Yeah, just that,
and the boy Marlo.

677
00:40:55,118 --> 00:40:55,845
Yeah, I'm on it.

678
00:40:59,211 --> 00:40:59,645
Yep.

679
00:41:19,835 --> 00:41:21,395
2303 to K.G.A.

680
00:41:23,241 --> 00:41:25,365
Have foxtrot meet me
on six, adam.

681
00:41:27,394 --> 00:41:28,438
<i>Foxtrot, ten four. </i>

682
00:41:28,602 --> 00:41:30,209
2303 to foxtrot.

683
00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:31,717
<i>Foxtrot, standing by. </i>

684
00:41:31,846 --> 00:41:33,863
It's a black Mercedes,
pulling out the lot.

685
00:41:33,887 --> 00:41:35,611
<i>Copy that, we got the eyeball. </i>

686
00:41:53,224 --> 00:41:54,233
This here the spot?

687
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,552
'Cause Tuckie says we supposed
to set-up shop here.

688
00:41:58,561 --> 00:41:59,417
Hamsterdam.

689
00:42:00,274 --> 00:42:01,435
Yeah, this is it.

690
00:42:01,623 --> 00:42:04,742
Set-up anywhere inside where
we got the white flags.

691
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:14,760
- Yo, I'm getting ready to roll out.
- You just got here, what's wrong?

692
00:42:14,772 --> 00:42:16,074
Ain't nobody 'round to buy.

693
00:42:18,467 --> 00:42:19,147
Good point.

694
00:42:22,924 --> 00:42:24,074
Man needs customers.

695
00:42:24,238 --> 00:42:25,692
- I'm sayin'...
- Aw, no.

696
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,008
You can't make me.
I'm a sworn fucking police officer.

697
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,743
Was' up, man.
You got that bodybag still?

698
00:42:48,536 --> 00:42:48,876
Two.

699
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:51,598
Narco!

700
00:42:58,101 --> 00:42:59,298
Give it up, motherfucker.

701
00:42:59,438 --> 00:43:00,834
Money comes back, right now.

702
00:43:04,846 --> 00:43:06,043
Boss, you fuckin' up, man.

703
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:08,189
You didn't even let me cop
'fore you snatch me up.

704
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:09,468
Is that some fuckin' rule?

705
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,745
You call, we haul.

706
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:14,974
You clean?

707
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:16,416
Yeah, of course I'm clean

708
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:18,856
stupid ass rookie didn't
even give me a chance to cop.

709
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:20,248
This corner's indicted.

710
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,333
You move over to Vincent Street
or we come back with the bracelets.

711
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:51,583
<i>What you got?</i>

712
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,593
1011 me at Riggs and Calhoun.

713
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:59,877
Despite unforeseen delays,
we will begin an academy class

714
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:04,217
this january, which leaves us in
good shape for the coming year.

715
00:44:05,402 --> 00:44:06,859
Thank you, Commissioner.

716
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:09,533
If the chair pleases,
I have a couple of questions.

717
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:11,891
Commissioner

718
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:14,026
I know you are aware
that a state's witness

719
00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:16,278
in a recent city homicide
prosecution was killed.

720
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:22,062
We are treating that incident
with the highest priority.

721
00:44:22,296 --> 00:44:24,079
Homicide has set-up a task force

722
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:26,531
and narcotics is working
the informant angle.

723
00:44:27,352 --> 00:44:30,743
We have also asked both the
F.B.I. and D.E.A. for support.

724
00:44:30,907 --> 00:44:32,549
It sounds like a full-court press

725
00:44:33,054 --> 00:44:34,015
but you must admit

726
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:36,807
it's a bit like closing the barn
door after the horse is out.

727
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,469
I mean, the shooting
of the boy on the lot

728
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:41,709
at Lake Clifton high school
was a high-profile case

729
00:44:41,733 --> 00:44:42,941
wasn't it, Commissioner?

730
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,193
Yes, it was.

731
00:44:45,217 --> 00:44:47,234
And yet a key witness
in the case was allowed...

732
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:48,994
one moment...

733
00:44:53,988 --> 00:44:56,381
excuse me, Commissioner,
but the chair was good enough

734
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:58,610
to remind me that you have
a pressing engagement.

735
00:44:58,903 --> 00:45:02,090
So if it's alright with you,
we can continue this at a later date.

736
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:03,556
Meeting adjourned.

737
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:10,313
Did you see Burrell sweat?

738
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:12,542
The man's collar almost melted.

739
00:45:12,812 --> 00:45:13,938
The hell got into you?

740
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:15,885
You did, old buddy.

741
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:17,047
You did.

742
00:45:32,793 --> 00:45:35,116
Nend of the line, all out.

743
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:39,770
We got that Rockefeller, yo.

744
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,951
We got that Rockefeller
over here, yo.

745
00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:44,180
Over here we got that
Rockefeller, yo.

746
00:45:44,204 --> 00:45:45,013
Whatta fuck?

747
00:45:47,397 --> 00:45:49,473
Yo, yo, we got
the Rockefeller, yo.

748
00:45:50,892 --> 00:45:53,743
We got that W.M.D.
right here, right here.

749
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,842
I hear the W.M.D. is the bomb.

750
00:45:56,285 --> 00:45:57,903
W.M.D. right here.

751
00:46:04,273 --> 00:46:05,313
W.M.D.

752
00:46:08,457 --> 00:46:09,865
Give me two, yo.

753
00:46:11,073 --> 00:46:12,950
W.M.D. right here.

754
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:16,648
W.M.D. right here, right here.

755
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:20,044
Right here.

756
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,786
We got that Rockefeller over here.

757
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:25,076
Yo!

758
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:27,845
We got that Rockefeller, yo.

759
00:46:33,403 --> 00:46:34,165
What do we got?

760
00:46:34,482 --> 00:46:36,101
There's binoculars on the floor.

761
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:43,959
Marlo making a move?

762
00:46:44,452 --> 00:46:45,414
Just watch.

763
00:46:46,657 --> 00:46:48,698
Forget everythin'
the boy, Bodie, told you.

764
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:51,889
Forget the beatin',
it ain't about that.

765
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,922
You smart, man, I can see that.

766
00:46:57,376 --> 00:46:59,887
I wanted you to choose
somewhere safe for us to speak.

767
00:46:59,922 --> 00:47:00,919
But goddamn

768
00:47:02,784 --> 00:47:05,279
only bugs in this
motherfucker gotta have legs.

769
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:09,080
Now, I appreciate smart

770
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,423
but you gotta know,
in this game, man, it ain't enough.

771
00:47:12,974 --> 00:47:14,135
You a student of history?

772
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,797
You know this town had its
share of smart players, man?

773
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:23,498
Melvin, Little Wil, Big Head Brother,
Peanut, Warren.

774
00:47:24,161 --> 00:47:26,729
All real smart, man, real smart.

775
00:47:27,774 --> 00:47:30,730
You know, soon as
their names rang out, bam

776
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:32,448
the feds was on them.

777
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:36,585
You know what I mean?
The government they want you to be

778
00:47:36,615 --> 00:47:39,190
organized, nah, they want you
scrimpin' and scrapin'

779
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:41,641
killin' each other on the
corners over some bullshit.

780
00:47:42,052 --> 00:47:42,756
Not me.

781
00:47:43,377 --> 00:47:44,558
That's why me and Prop Joe

782
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,658
we gettin' ready to put
this co-op together.

783
00:47:47,174 --> 00:47:50,118
Different crews, one package.
Best dope, best coke.

784
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,500
Share and share alike.

785
00:47:53,344 --> 00:47:54,603
I've been hearin' 'bout that.

786
00:47:54,614 --> 00:47:55,987
You've been hearin' 'bout that?

787
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,239
That's good,
that's a start, right?

788
00:47:58,767 --> 00:48:01,371
You know that Mercedes you
got ridin' out there, man

789
00:48:01,477 --> 00:48:04,515
you got that titled in your
aunt's name or some shit.

790
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,753
Now, when they come get you

791
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:11,507
that straw purchase out there
gonna come bite you in the ass, boy.

792
00:48:12,691 --> 00:48:13,735
That's what's they do.

793
00:48:14,345 --> 00:48:15,612
Turn your money against you.

794
00:48:16,854 --> 00:48:19,587
Now, you I'm thinkin'
with the corners you got

795
00:48:20,889 --> 00:48:22,215
you close to a mil, right?

796
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,185
I'm doin' a-ight.

797
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,476
You doing a-ight

798
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,910
but a-ight ain't got you
a name on your crib, right?

799
00:48:30,013 --> 00:48:32,652
Ain't got you a little spot
to wash that dirty money?

800
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:36,007
That what I'm offerin' you, man.

801
00:48:41,077 --> 00:48:42,402
Come on, who's he in there with?

802
00:48:42,613 --> 00:48:44,420
I told you, keep watchin'.

803
00:48:46,168 --> 00:48:47,622
Did Bunk put you
up to this?

804
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:50,844
Tell you what, how about
a case of that PBR piss

805
00:48:50,856 --> 00:48:53,988
you drink against a touch of the
Irish that he went out the back

806
00:48:53,999 --> 00:48:56,052
and you're watching
that house for nothing.

807
00:48:57,331 --> 00:48:58,586
Here comes your nothing.

808
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,917
I like my piss in bottles.

809
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,369
Anyway you like, darlin'.

810
00:49:16,378 --> 00:49:17,246
Chris...

811
00:49:18,865 --> 00:49:20,320
tell our people to tool up.

812
00:49:22,957 --> 00:49:23,789
I'm on it.

813
00:49:32,758 --> 00:49:35,080
I got that W.M.D., got that W.M.D.

814
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:42,136
They got comfortable
with it pretty quick.

815
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,740
Yeah, it's like we ain't
even standing here.

816
00:49:45,268 --> 00:49:47,168
The hoppers call it Hamsterdam.

817
00:49:48,763 --> 00:49:49,725
Like from Amsterdam.

818
00:49:51,801 --> 00:49:52,693
Hamsterdam.

819
00:49:57,414 --> 00:50:00,171
...are the use of integrated
math concepts such as

820
00:50:00,194 --> 00:50:03,690
algebraic reasoning, and number
sines, geometry and probability.

821
00:50:04,025 --> 00:50:05,175
Very impressive.

822
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:07,779
Now what we try to do is
keep the class size under 10

823
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:08,776
12 at the very most.

824
00:50:08,788 --> 00:50:11,122
- And there are three levels?
- Yes, so that if...

825
00:50:11,228 --> 00:50:13,046
Sorry, I'm Jim McNulty.

826
00:50:13,105 --> 00:50:14,881
I'm runnin' a little late
because of work.

827
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:15,866
Mr. McNulty.

828
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:19,948
I have some concerns about
the integrated math program.

829
00:50:19,972 --> 00:50:23,503
In their previous schools,
Michael took introductory algebra

830
00:50:23,514 --> 00:50:26,162
but I understand that this school
is doing something different.

831
00:50:26,185 --> 00:50:27,792
We are.
The integrated math program...

832
00:50:27,804 --> 00:50:28,859
Excuse me, I'm thirsty

833
00:50:28,871 --> 00:50:30,901
can I get either of you
somethin' to drink?

834
00:50:31,557 --> 00:50:33,575
The integrated math
program here consist...

835
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:44,730
Not much of a spread, but you
can't go wrong with crudite.

836
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:45,997
Crudity?

837
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:50,525
I'm sorry, you know,
I came straight from work

838
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:51,381
or I'da changed.

839
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,824
No need to call names, right?

840
00:50:54,478 --> 00:50:56,050
What do you do, Mr...

841
00:50:56,709 --> 00:50:58,105
I'm on the board at Legg Mason.

842
00:50:58,422 --> 00:50:59,407
Jim McNulty.

843
00:51:00,522 --> 00:51:01,307
Legg Mason?

844
00:51:02,082 --> 00:51:04,709
Either that or I'm a cop
in the city, I keep forgetting.

845
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,456
Terri d'Agostino.

846
00:51:10,054 --> 00:51:13,573
I'm an alumna and one of
the school's dreaded fundraisers.

847
00:51:15,344 --> 00:51:18,218
The math program offers
tutoring possibilities.

848
00:51:18,468 --> 00:51:20,369
So if Michael finds it
difficult adjusting

849
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:23,501
we can have classes
on tuesdays and thursdays.

850
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:25,917
So how do you find the school?

851
00:51:26,152 --> 00:51:26,609
It's good.

852
00:51:27,759 --> 00:51:30,055
My ex and I are thinking
of sending our boys here.

853
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,961
- Any problems, difficulties?
- No, not really.

854
00:51:34,442 --> 00:51:38,368
I mean, there's the math
integration class for my oldest.

855
00:51:38,626 --> 00:51:41,043
He's in sixth, seventh, and...

856
00:51:42,427 --> 00:51:44,890
I'm not sure he's ready,
you know, for all that math.

857
00:52:11,939 --> 00:52:13,757
Careful, I'm only a country boy.

858
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:15,282
Shut up!

859
00:52:32,283 --> 00:52:33,697
<i>Hey, sweetie, welcome home. </i>

860
00:52:47,783 --> 00:52:48,534
Welcome back.

861
00:52:50,727 --> 00:52:51,584
Hey, sis.

862
00:52:52,487 --> 00:52:53,449
Aw, man.

863
00:52:54,493 --> 00:52:57,191
I just wish I wasn't the only
one comin' home, you know?

864
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,065
I know.

865
00:53:00,684 --> 00:53:02,666
Enjoy tonight, we'll talk later.

866
00:53:05,126 --> 00:53:05,724
Welcome home.

867
00:53:05,748 --> 00:53:07,460
What up, Prop,
how you feelin', man?

868
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:07,871
Alright.

869
00:53:08,598 --> 00:53:09,654
You lookin' fit.

870
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:12,234
Hell, yeah, I've been
working out in there.

871
00:53:12,246 --> 00:53:13,501
All you gotta do is work out.

872
00:53:13,529 --> 00:53:16,532
Might be a good place for a fat
man to find his inner-self.

873
00:53:43,594 --> 00:53:44,075
Yo.

874
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:48,238
I got some downtown suits wanna
hollar with you real quick.

875
00:53:49,645 --> 00:53:52,390
Takin' me to see suits,
I'm tryin' to see some skirts.

876
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:05,979
So what do you do?

877
00:54:08,405 --> 00:54:09,495
You should get dressed.

878
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,715
I got a lot of work here.

879
00:54:14,962 --> 00:54:16,557
It's a long day for me tomorrow.

880
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:20,882
I'll be really quiet.

881
00:54:25,069 --> 00:54:27,275
You never know, you might
get bored workin'.

882
00:54:28,459 --> 00:54:29,209
I gotta work.

883
00:54:32,951 --> 00:54:33,631
You gotta go...

884
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,391
What Stringer's done with
all that property downtown

885
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:47,770
Avon, I cannot tell the kind
of profit you're looking at

886
00:54:47,793 --> 00:54:50,116
once all the federal
redevelopment money lands.

887
00:54:50,355 --> 00:54:52,560
That whole howard street
thing is gonna take off

888
00:54:52,572 --> 00:54:55,094
and you're gonna be right
there to cut the pie yourself.

889
00:54:55,117 --> 00:54:58,214
Any dollar you spend now
is going to come back to you ten times.

890
00:54:58,496 --> 00:54:59,716
And the thing is?

891
00:54:59,939 --> 00:55:02,120
I know you don't wanna
go back to them streets.

892
00:55:02,437 --> 00:55:03,939
Not after what you been through.

893
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,836
I know, because I'm from
those same streets.

894
00:55:07,188 --> 00:55:09,499
And once I had the chance
to play a different game

895
00:55:09,522 --> 00:55:11,598
there wasn't a question
in my mind how to go.

896
00:55:11,751 --> 00:55:14,223
The government is going to be
looking at you hard, too.

897
00:55:14,246 --> 00:55:16,510
No sense in giving them
what they're looking for.

898
00:55:16,533 --> 00:55:18,481
You take what you have,
you build on it.

899
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,214
It's all good.
Just put it up on the calendar.

900
00:55:21,525 --> 00:55:22,463
We should meet.

901
00:55:27,061 --> 00:55:28,070
Yo, Slim.

902
00:55:28,668 --> 00:55:30,534
You see the two niggas right there.

903
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,252
They over here gettin' high
in the middle of all this...

904
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:35,539
where the fucking
discipline at, yo?

905
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,577
Fuck, toss them niggers.

906
00:56:00,109 --> 00:56:01,200
Talk to me for a second.

907
00:56:01,211 --> 00:56:03,299
don't you know not
to stare at me like that.

908
00:56:03,776 --> 00:56:07,002
Yo. I got to show you something.

909
00:56:07,706 --> 00:56:08,750
Pardon me, sweetie.

910
00:56:08,773 --> 00:56:09,477
Hey, yo, man.

911
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:11,225
You know I've been locked down.

912
00:56:11,985 --> 00:56:13,897
You gonna love this.
Trust me.

913
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,896
Ah, shit, this ain't
my little place down in jessup.

914
00:56:33,919 --> 00:56:37,051
But you know what I mean,
what the fuck is, right?

915
00:56:37,134 --> 00:56:38,365
This is all you, B.

916
00:56:39,116 --> 00:56:41,251
All you, in your name, too.

917
00:56:42,403 --> 00:56:43,389
You know what I mean?

918
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,559
This piece of paper right
here makes it legit.

919
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:49,219
Keys to the navigator,
in the basement.

920
00:56:49,312 --> 00:56:51,717
It's just a rental 'til
you pick out somethin' nice.

921
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:54,271
Damn, all this, huh?

922
00:56:54,893 --> 00:56:55,843
You did good.

923
00:56:56,734 --> 00:56:59,268
Yeah, I mean we're makin'
so much straight money, man

924
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:02,705
we can carry shit like this out
in the open, in our own names.

925
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:06,177
Yo, you remember when
we used to sit on the top

926
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,113
of 734 buildin', man?

927
00:57:08,253 --> 00:57:10,822
Lookin' at the city,
talk about what we goin' do?

928
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,860
And you was all heavy into
that black pride bullshit

929
00:57:14,015 --> 00:57:16,361
talkin' about you gonna
get you two grocery stores

930
00:57:16,384 --> 00:57:17,956
make motherfuckers proud.

931
00:57:17,991 --> 00:57:22,050
Sure was, man, you was out
huntin' on a ak-47.

932
00:57:22,425 --> 00:57:24,381
Talkin' about
how I'm gonna get Warren.

933
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:27,662
Man...

934
00:57:31,674 --> 00:57:32,518
We brothers, B.

935
00:57:33,809 --> 00:57:34,759
Always, baby.

936
00:57:36,611 --> 00:57:37,339
Always.

937
00:57:40,036 --> 00:57:42,171
Hey, just one more thin', man.

938
00:57:42,746 --> 00:57:45,147
I don't mean to be pickin'
with you about this but...

939
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:47,590
especially not after
you did all this shit for me

940
00:57:47,669 --> 00:57:49,487
but, look, man,
I've been locked down.

941
00:57:49,558 --> 00:57:50,555
You know what I mean?

942
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:53,968
You know what?
I got take this meet, you know?

943
00:57:54,074 --> 00:57:56,792
I'm gonna get at you,
welcome home, man.

944
00:58:08,004 --> 00:58:09,951
Hey, yo, it's me, man,
I left somethin'.

945
00:58:23,014 --> 00:58:25,009
Aw, shit, my man.

946
