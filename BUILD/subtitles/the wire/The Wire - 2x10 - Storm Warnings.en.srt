1
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,011
Fucking-A.

2
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,075
Yeah, shit is good.

3
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,343
Here. Next time we re-up, though...

4
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,818
tell Moe man we need about 700,
800 more of them dimes, all right?

5
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:52,118
I ain't even seen shit like this
since I don't know when.

6
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:55,921
- Same with the jumbos?
- Yeah, better get more of those, too.

7
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:06,969
What the fuck is up now?
String, what's up, man?

8
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,938
What up? Can't call it.

9
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,570
- How's our package?
- How's it look? Shit is good.

10
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:18,579
See these Eastside motherfuckers
over here?

11
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,780
I want you to extend
to these motherfuckers...

12
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:25,448
all the hospitality that
West Baltimore is famous for.

13
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,186
- You heard?
- You want us to fuck them up?

14
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,488
No, dawg.

15
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:33,797
We're giving them 221, 734, and Saratoga.

16
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,728
We keep the rest. If anybody start any shit...

17
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,599
they'll have to answer to me,
all right? Directly.

18
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,904
You heard me, right?

19
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,007
All right.

20
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,443
What are these off-brand niggers gonna do
with a project tower?

21
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:54,883
Fall back, young 'un.

22
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,718
We're gonna show y'all motherfuckers
how to grind out here, all right?

23
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,492
Hey, String.

24
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,589
I heard you, man, I did.

25
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,428
But this shit right here,
it don't make no sense.

26
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,071
You like the new product we selling?

27
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,667
It make sense now?

28
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,108
- Where are we at with our Boss Man?
- We should be up on his phone soon.

29
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,122
- The PC is there, no question.
- We get up on his cellphone, he's done.

30
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:33,589
We'll ID him, no problem.

31
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:37,128
I don't know. They came down on that
warehouse phone when we spooked them.

32
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:40,665
Sobotka's cellphone, too.
We might be going up on a dead line.

33
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,859
This is the other way to go.

34
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:46,093
Compared to the wiretap,
it's the longer way around.

35
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,231
But still, if he's changing up
on his cellphone...

36
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,799
Over the last week or so...

37
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,438
we've not only confirmed the identities
of some of the key players...

38
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,176
we've also got GPS trackers
on all their cars.

39
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,808
First of all...

40
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,281
Eton Ben-Eleazer.
He's the drug Lieutenant in the warehouse.

41
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,382
- E-ton.
- Whatever.

42
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:10,357
Our madam, Miss Ilona Petrovna.

43
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,560
George Glekas, who runs
the appliance store over in Highlandtown...

44
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:18,626
and the probable fence for the organization.
We followed some of them in real time.

45
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:22,298
With this little toy here,
there's something else we can do.

46
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,672
That's seven days
of where our targets have been, sped up.

47
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,647
And lookit. Two locations only...

48
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,345
where three or four cars stopped
at the same time for more than five minutes.

49
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:37,888
One "X" is a dive of a diner
down on South Clinton.

50
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,357
The other is on the western shore
of Fort Howard down past Edgemere.

51
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,055
We get up on these locations,
maybe we get a photo of the Boss Man.

52
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,961
- Or a tag number.
- It's totally cool.

53
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,593
- Where did you even get this stuff?
- DEA for the trackers.

54
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:54,464
McNulty pulled the software
from his pals at the FBI field office.

55
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:58,134
We can pull Herc and Carver
off the warehouse and give them the diner.

56
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,179
McNulty, Bunk, you guys take Fort Howard.

57
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,246
What the fuck, Frank?

58
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,353
You might as well
start posting them things, right?

59
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:48,684
I mean, shit, if you're gonna run,
you might as well come out and say so.

60
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,464
It ain't personal, Ott.

61
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:59,435
I want to finish what I started
with the dredging issue.

62
00:08:59,538 --> 00:09:02,405
And you don't think I'm good enough
to handle it.

63
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,769
It ain't about that, kiddo.

64
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:09,480
Ott, listen to me!

65
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:20,118
What the fuck do you want me to do?
Tell him where the money comes from?

66
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,353
I.B.S.?

67
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:27,959
Not to brag, but union racketeering
is one thing the Bureau does well.

68
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,834
That is exactly what I wanted to hear.
This case needs closure, boys.

69
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,200
And in my heart of hearts...

70
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:40,006
I know you're the kind of bastards
to put Sobotka where he needs to be.

71
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,549
One other thing
you Federals can help me with.

72
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,216
And if you don't mind,
a little discretion is called for.

73
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,356
That, right there,
is the district surveillance van...

74
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,330
which was fully equipped
when it disappeared.

75
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:01,592
A surveillance van?

76
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,726
Sobotka stole it.
Now it's I-don't-know-where.

77
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,271
The last picture was from Seattle...

78
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,841
but I got prints...

79
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,202
from two other places, see?

80
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:15,145
You reported the van stolen, right?

81
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:20,845
It was my feeling that the theft
of a vehicle from a departmental lot...

82
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,513
would reflect poorly on the department.

83
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,592
The thing is, I know you boys
have got enough reach...

84
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:31,390
to maybe get the van back
without no big dustup.

85
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,098
As a favor for me
having brought you the whole case.

86
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,800
Motherfucking Eastside
need to get their asses...

87
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,067
back across town where they belong.

88
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:46,842
Yo, man, we run them off,
we run off the good dope so...

89
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:49,971
I'm just saying
they all the time hustling around...

90
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,846
cutting prices and doing shit. It ain't right.

91
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:57,855
Walk, nigger.

92
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,394
Yo, what's up, soldier?

93
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:06,331
- Looking maybe to do something here.
- With him? This motherfucker?

94
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,231
- Looking maybe to do something here.
- With him? This motherfucker?

95
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,063
I saw him over on Ashland last week
selling burns.

96
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,365
- Fuck y'all, nigger.
- Look, what did he say?

97
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,633
$25, two dimes and a coke kicker.

98
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:19,108
I'll give you two dimes for $15,
plus the ice on top for free. What?

99
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,610
That'll work.

100
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,573
Take it in the lobby. I'll be right behind you.

101
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,116
That's what's up, see?

102
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,847
The game now is that we gotta sell
more of this good shit than they do.

103
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,252
What? Get the fuck out of here!

104
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:33,483
You mean to tell me
there's a Westside nigger...

105
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,993
who knows how to sell shit
without sticking a pistol in a fiend's face?

106
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,087
Yeah, dawg. And you better get used to it...

107
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,395
'cause y'all ain't selling shit
until we bone-ass dry.

108
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,527
- Believe that.
- All right, nigger. Whatever, man.

109
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:48,832
All right, cottage-cheese,
chest-ass motherfucker.

110
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,812
- Where do you want it?
- There's good.

111
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:03,349
Easy.

112
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:10,317
- We could help you set it up.
- You have a surveillance to cover?

113
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:21,836
- I got that feeling again.
- Like they don't think we're potty trained.

114
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:26,805
- Can I help you?
- FBI. Lt. Daniels?

115
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:29,876
He's in his office.

116
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:35,309
Without that billboard in my face,
I wouldn't have known.

117
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,115
How could you have known?

118
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:41,517
- There was the wingtips.
- And the beady eyes. Definite giveaway.

119
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,595
- Tight asses.
- Definitely.

120
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:52,334
Lt. Daniels? Agents Settles and Mason.

121
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:55,932
Maj. Valchek said you'd be expecting us.

122
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,703
You listening to this fool?

123
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:04,009
Saying that the Eastside
is wilder than Westside...

124
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,381
'cause of some shit
about Eastside folks drinking port wine...

125
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,579
while the Westside do sherry?

126
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:13,624
Port make a man do crazy shit,
I'm telling you.

127
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:17,991
- Butchie, talk to this fool.
- For me, leastways...

128
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:21,429
the difference between East and West
goes back to one man:

129
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:23,797
- Frank Matthews.
- Pee Wee Matthews?

130
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:27,895
Yeah, the brother went up New York
and got in bed with them Italians.

131
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:31,237
The only one from this town
got a piece of that French Connection.

132
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,334
What the hell Pee Wee
got to do with anything?

133
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:37,643
'Cause Frank was Westside. How do you
like that? The dope flowed West.

134
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:41,810
When you got a steady supply,
you run shit like a business.

135
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,550
Somebody gets hurt, there's a reason.
Not like this foolishness we got today.

136
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,959
Excuse me.

137
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,359
What say, Omar?

138
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,725
Ain't no thing.

139
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:02,000
You know I got something for you, right?
Wouldn't come around unless I did.

140
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,537
What up, Butch?
How you holding up, baby?

141
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,240
Except for fretting on you, I'm good.

142
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,951
It's for my people.

143
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,721
A little something for a rainy day.

144
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,803
You built up a right nice-size nest
these past couple of years.

145
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:37,841
Might be time you maybe think
about backing off some?

146
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,472
Back off to what?

147
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,037
Later, Butch.

148
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,681
Stay, boy.

149
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,289
Damn, Zig, I ain't got it cut yet.

150
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,792
And turn that shit down, for Christ's sake.

151
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:57,988
Nicely done.

152
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,116
Like I always say,
it pays to go with a union card every time.

153
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:05,094
- Turn the fucking radio down, Zig.
- Will you get in the goddamn car already?

154
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,257
For Christ's sake,
we ain't got all night. Jesus!

155
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,933
You could drive a tank through there,
it wouldn't take a scratch.

156
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,410
Where the fuck you going with this?

157
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,950
Greece. Athens, Greece.

158
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,421
The hole is so they don't think
it's an inside job.

159
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,083
So they don't look at the union.

160
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:35,955
Welcome aboard, chief.

161
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,012
Is that you?

162
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,855
I thought you were gonna go shopping.

163
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:46,690
- Me?
- Yeah.

164
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,464
We round-the-clock with surveillance.

165
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:54,769
When do we get to the part
where you do all kind of shit for me?

166
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,000
When do we get to that part?

167
00:17:57,442 --> 00:18:01,003
So you past the point
of lifting a grocery bag or two?

168
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:04,981
You try being me like this.

169
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,359
Something wrong?

170
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:37,110
The baby's kicking. Wanna feel?

171
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,633
- Almost $4,000.
- I know it is.

172
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,776
The Greek guy, the one with the warehouse,
pays me in cash.

173
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:09,472
Keeps it off the books,
so he don't have to pay taxes and benefits.

174
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:13,381
- And you saved all that?
- He gave me a bump, too.

175
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:15,845
I'm pulling down $700 a week.

176
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:19,285
You don't believe me?

177
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,721
Christ.

178
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,889
I was saving that up to give to you
for the new apartment.

179
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,660
You know what I'm saying, dawg?

180
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,136
But I don't understand how these hoes
be acting sometimes and shit.

181
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:12,073
If I tell a bitch, I'm like,
"Bitch, either you suck dick or you don't."

182
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,510
- Gentlemen.
- What's up, my brother?

183
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:20,073
Are you slinging bean pies up in here?
You know what I mean?

184
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:23,754
You with the nation, homey?
'Cause either you're a Muslim...

185
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:27,689
or your momma need to stop
laying your clothes out in the morning.

186
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,888
I'm here to represent the interests
of a Mr. Barksdale.

187
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:36,434
- Are you familiar with Mr. Barksdale?
- That name ring out, but so do mine.

188
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,102
And you are?

189
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:41,228
Cheese, man.

190
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:43,273
Mr. Cheese. I see.

191
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:47,704
- And who do you work for, Mr. Cheese?
- Who do I work for?

192
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:51,270
Am I correct in assuming that
you are not employed by Mr. Barksdale?

193
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,441
Hell, yeah.

194
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,145
If that is the case,
then I have to insist that you leave.

195
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:59,685
- This nigger serious?
- Let me be emphatic.

196
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,192
You need to take your black ass
across Charles Street to where it belong.

197
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:05,057
- What?
- Hold on now.

198
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:10,129
He don't know what this is. It ain't
what he think, you know what I'm saying?

199
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:14,535
First of all, we got permission
to grind in these here towers.

200
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:17,203
Second of all, I don't give a fuck...

201
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,141
Get off me, get off!

202
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,585
Pellets in plastic. Rat shot.

203
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:33,890
What you need to be concerned about
is what's seated in the chamber now:

204
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:35,516
a copper-jacketed, hollow point...

205
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,926
120-grain hot street load
of my own creation.

206
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:43,194
So you need to think for just a moment
and ask yourself:

207
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:48,434
What do I have to do
before this man raise up his gun again?

208
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,106
Let's go.

209
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,513
Good day to you, sir.

210
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:08,048
I'm in agreement
with the agents' assessment.

211
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,490
As far as I can see...

212
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,222
this case is an ideal candidate
for RICO prosecution.

213
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,767
My agency agrees RICO is the way to go,
so we'll be in your courthouse, not mine.

214
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,563
But I want one thing on record.

215
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,231
As of 9/11,
the Bureau has one priority in this case:

216
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,101
it's waterfront corruption.

217
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,871
It's a new world
and the ports are vulnerable.

218
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,468
This case is bigger than the union.

219
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,071
We're agreeing to take on
the whole case, Lieutenant.

220
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:34,174
But the union is why
we're in the room with you.

221
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:37,721
If you're okay with that,
we can work the case together.

222
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:47,623
We'll copy all the Bureau's 302s
to the Lieutenant and Miss Pearlman.

223
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:50,701
Your paperwork should CC Squad 6
and my office, as well.

224
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:54,366
I'll start pumping your casework
into our system.

225
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:56,963
See what leads that might generate.

226
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,245
Oughtn't you be laid up resting?

227
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,177
A gunshot ain't nothing to trifle with.

228
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,278
Shoulder do hurt.

229
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,389
But this here work just fine.

230
00:23:17,595 --> 00:23:21,224
Tell Stack to polish it up good
and put $7.50 on it.

231
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:25,262
Shame to let a good toaster get away
over a frayed cord.

232
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:32,067
First off, ain't nobody running
up in them projects.

233
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,510
Them Westside boys are hurting over this
more than even you.

234
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:39,276
Trust me,
soon as our good shit run out, they fucked.

235
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:43,317
Second, a whole passel of hard-ass hitters...

236
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:47,187
took a go at Brother Mouzone,
and ain't lived to say shit about it.

237
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,159
We go at the boy,
no telling what might get stirred up.

238
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:53,992
If Stringer takes a shot,
he crosses Avon on it.

239
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:55,497
Put a bounty on him.

240
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,125
Let some bushwhacking fiend
back-shoot his ass.

241
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,171
I pin money on him,
and first thing he come at me?

242
00:24:01,372 --> 00:24:05,365
Shit. Might as well just shoot myself now
and get it over.

243
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:13,540
There is one boy
who might could just pull this off.

244
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,152
Only, he won't take contract money.

245
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,645
Aim for center mass.
Make sure the man goes down.

246
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,154
No problem.

247
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,951
I got the three on the left.

248
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,958
Fuck you, assholes.

249
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,833
- How you doing?
- How you doing, buddy?

250
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,199
The Samsung S221. You got that?

251
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,664
I don't see it.

252
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:18,742
Doing the old inventory, are we?

253
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,819
I hope there ain't been no thieving going on.

254
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,746
Not like the problem we got
down at the docks.

255
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:28,724
- You get the cars off?
- Sailed two hours ago on the Caspia.

256
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:31,795
Listed as scrap aluminum.
I got the bill of lading right here.

257
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:33,227
Not here.

258
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,064
In my office.

259
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:43,897
Forgive me, but how am I to know...

260
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:46,568
you did not ship them empty?

261
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,771
I just don't know. Let me see.

262
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,817
Maybe if I had a 4.0 Megapix,
three time optical, fully digitalized camera...

263
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:57,984
I could've taken some quality photos
of them Benzes in those cans.

264
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:01,654
But oops. I forgot my camera got busted.

265
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,693
Or you know what I could do?

266
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,593
I could get old Boris
to skulk around them docks...

267
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,928
keep the old commie red eye
on them containers.

268
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:11,263
Make sure the dock boys
are playing me straight.

269
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,961
- They are what I order?
- Yes.

270
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,972
I got you the S series
in the colors that you wanted.

271
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,167
I even got one parked outside.
You wanna see?

272
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,244
Outside? Now?

273
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:24,611
I'm just taking her out for a spin, chief.
I'll put her back tonight.

274
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:43,996
Wait one.

275
00:26:45,536 --> 00:26:48,403
Them cars list out
at better than $60,000 each.

276
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:52,169
20% was last week. Today, the quote is 10%.

277
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:56,705
Still, it's good money for a few hours' work.

278
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:58,543
No!

279
00:26:58,649 --> 00:27:03,484
No fucking way!
We had a deal, motherfucker. A deal.

280
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:05,820
You listen to me.

281
00:27:05,923 --> 00:27:08,653
It was my fucking ass out there
on the line. Mine.

282
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,127
This piddling shit
is the best that you come up with?

283
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,730
You don't play me like that. You don't.

284
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:30,613
Fuck you, you thieving, Greek cunt.

285
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:31,909
Malaka!

286
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,620
You don't know that one, chief.
But you know "malaka," yes?

287
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,025
Now you know malaka with dress.

288
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:01,199
Please.

289
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,470
Malaka.

290
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,080
Can you hear me?

291
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,721
If you can talk, please stay on the line.

292
00:30:57,588 --> 00:31:00,056
Get in the boat first,
then put the preserver on.

293
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:02,318
- It's easier that way.
- Yeah?

294
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,689
Y'all trying to drown my ass for sure.

295
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,795
- Come on.
- Don't push me, man.

296
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:21,942
Rod.

297
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:25,471
Got it.

298
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:29,318
Here. Hold on to that.

299
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,153
I know this one.

300
00:31:47,838 --> 00:31:50,432
Stringer Bell will come at me with this.

301
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:54,307
Says he's got something with Omar
he need to make straight.

302
00:31:55,212 --> 00:31:57,407
Didn't say what that might be?

303
00:31:57,948 --> 00:32:02,044
Wouldn't tell me.
And to be truthful, I didn't want to know.

304
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:09,391
No. It don't feel right.

305
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:12,360
You know them Barksdale people
ain't to be trusted.

306
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:16,900
No denying all you say is true.
But Stringer talking parley.

307
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,368
So your boy needs to think
long and hard on this.

308
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,907
'Cause if Omar is living his day-to-day
in the street...

309
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:28,001
there ain't no telling what their next step
might be if there ain't no sit-down.

310
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,104
- "Parley"?
- That's all he says he's looking for.

311
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,911
I'll talk to him.

312
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:41,186
But if it feels funny to him
the way it does to me...

313
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,887
I got a better chance
of putting a leash to the wind, you know?

314
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:49,461
If you think it might help,
I can go protection.

315
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:54,027
- They're the one got hurt the last time.
- Then there was a reason to meet.

316
00:32:55,806 --> 00:32:59,173
- This time feel different.
- I hear you.

317
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,036
Maybe Stringer's still trying
to settle that beef...

318
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,014
behind the fact
that he got to live in this city, too...

319
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,912
Omar being Omar.

320
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:13,412
If it ain't putting you out none...

321
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:17,426
I'd feel a powerful lot better
if my nephew took over protection.

322
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,726
Hayward.

323
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,806
Typed and ready for your John Hancock.

324
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:46,146
- Thanks.
- Sure.

325
00:34:04,975 --> 00:34:09,173
You just have to initial each page
and then sign at the end.

326
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:15,251
I'm just checking.
This is the official record, right, chief?

327
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,353
It's what's gonna play in court.

328
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,818
Can I change something?

329
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,189
Yeah.

330
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:37,070
Just put your initials next to your changes.
It's no problem.

331
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,609
Yeah, it's only one.

332
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:44,170
- You know, you typed "said" here, see?
- "Said"?

333
00:34:52,189 --> 00:34:55,056
He wasn't saying, "Please don't shoot me."

334
00:34:56,827 --> 00:34:58,692
It was more begging.

335
00:35:01,398 --> 00:35:05,732
You know? Double G, he's begging me.

336
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,468
But that's not gonna mess you up,
though, right?

337
00:35:13,477 --> 00:35:16,913
No, it's more descriptive like that.
It's good. Thanks.

338
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,238
Quiet. No one in or out of there.

339
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:04,090
It's kind of nice out here.
Moonlight on the water.

340
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,727
Waves lapping gently against the boat.

341
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,497
I'm working my regular eight.
I can handle it, you know?

342
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,032
But a detail like this...

343
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,075
That's what I'm asking.

344
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:25,774
If something comes up on the job,
how would you handle it?

345
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,879
I mean, at home with the kids.

346
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,081
Until now, not much came up.

347
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,558
But now, say something comes up.

348
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:40,388
I mean, say we do a raid or something.
What would you do?

349
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,763
I guess I'd try to get the sitter to stay.

350
00:36:44,868 --> 00:36:47,462
Maybe call my folks, like I did tonight.

351
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:51,232
You know how it is with kids.
You gotta be there.

352
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,534
But you wouldn't miss it?

353
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:58,274
I mean, with everybody rolling out
and you having to head home?

354
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:04,581
If it keeps going like this,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

355
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,918
- Thanks.
- It's no problem.

356
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:15,029
You wanna make a phone call to someone?

357
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:19,401
If you get over to Madison,
it might be some time before you can.

358
00:37:19,536 --> 00:37:22,027
Ain't a chance I get a bail, right?

359
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,707
How about family?

360
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:45,460
All right, to bring you up to speed,
we've got agents in Le Havre...

361
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:49,498
shagging leads from the manifest
of the Talco ship due here in a few days.

362
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,660
To see if we can't pinpoint the origin
for the illegal containers.

363
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,499
That's a lot of cans.

364
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,039
A hundred and ten, actually.

365
00:37:57,241 --> 00:38:01,302
How many agents you need to track back
to where all those cans came from?

366
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,107
As many as it takes.

367
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:09,278
We may be assholes, but on the upside,
there's an awful lot of us.

368
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,246
Let me get this into the computer
for the boys overseas.

369
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:21,422
Anything from that shithole of a diner?

370
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:24,195
Herc and Carver had nothing overnight.

371
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:27,464
The feds took over this morning
and it's still quiet.

372
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,664
I'm going back on the water.

373
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:33,468
One meet and we're on this guy.

374
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:15,516
The Talco line's in Wednesday.
I'll send Nick for a number.

375
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:18,785
- The Greeks again?
- Who else?

376
00:39:19,456 --> 00:39:22,220
They sure do stir up the shit,
them Greeks do.

377
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:28,693
- Uncle Frank.
- Nicky boy, just in time.

378
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,632
- Uncle Frank.
- What? What happened?

379
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:36,302
- What the fuck is it this time?
- He shot...

380
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:40,370
They're saying he shot two of the Greeks.

381
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:43,079
- Last night, they're saying.
- Shot?

382
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,172
- He shot?
- Fucking Christ!

383
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:50,219
He's locked up.
He's fucking charged with murder.

384
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,550
- The Greeks?
- Double G.

385
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,391
And one of the kids that works
down the store on the avenue with him.

386
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:58,620
They're saying he walked in there.

387
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,095
- He went in.
- Why was he there?

388
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:04,163
- Where the fuck were you?
- Uncle Frank, I didn't know.

389
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:05,758
What didn't you know?

390
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:09,100
- What is Ziggy doing near the Greeks?
- I don't know.

391
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,901
You don't know? You're supposed to.
You're his fucking cousin!

392
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,202
You're his father.

393
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,049
1,125 kilograms.

394
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,891
Not that drug enforcement's my cup of tea...

395
00:40:30,994 --> 00:40:34,452
but I'm told
it was the largest crack seizure on record.

396
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,665
I just wish I had good news for you.

397
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,062
You told me this was a local effort.

398
00:40:43,173 --> 00:40:47,610
It's sprawled. Now the Bureau's involved.
We're looking hard at the port unions.

399
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,372
My hands are tied.

400
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:55,011
They're on you with wiretaps.

401
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,853
Several phones, several addresses.

402
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,037
Stefanos.

403
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,749
Have the boy go to Eton.

404
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:29,114
Tell him to come right away
to the other place.

405
00:41:29,219 --> 00:41:32,484
- You're not calling?
- No phones. No more phones.

406
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,557
Adieu, my friend.

407
00:41:47,804 --> 00:41:49,635
They forgot your fries.

408
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,168
No, they forgot your fries.

409
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,507
- My fries are right in here.
- Those are my fries.

410
00:41:56,146 --> 00:42:00,139
Bitch, everything I say, you hear backwards.
The fries are mine, boy.

411
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,048
Go ahead.

412
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,180
Eat the fries, you fat fuck.
See if I fucking care.

413
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:10,055
What? You think I'm fat?

414
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:19,862
There's our boy.

415
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,231
- Lester, Eton's on the move.
- We got it.

416
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,535
- No need for an eyeball follow, right?
- No need.

417
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,275
A fine fucking kettle of fish.

418
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:36,011
I heard it,
but I had to come see it for myself.

419
00:42:36,386 --> 00:42:38,911
- And sure enough...
- Major?

420
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:43,017
You know,
I put my faith in you fucking feds.

421
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:45,688
You let me down.

422
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:49,294
- Major, we can talk in my office.
- Lieutenant.

423
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,331
It's Lieutenant, right?

424
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:55,133
I gave you a simple assignment:

425
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,365
that fellow, the one in the corner.

426
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,244
And to make it happen, I gave you all this.

427
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,947
Good digs, people...

428
00:43:06,616 --> 00:43:08,550
everything you needed.

429
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,919
And what did you give me?

430
00:43:11,154 --> 00:43:14,646
Right up the fucking ass, Lieutenant.

431
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:18,255
- Major, you're going to get--
- Roland, get your shit.

432
00:43:18,595 --> 00:43:20,688
You want to do it your way, fine.

433
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,799
But you ain't gonna use my people
to fuck me.

434
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:30,796
- Get your gear. I'm pulling you.
- I got... There's work...

435
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:34,674
- You said--
- Get your narrow ass back to the district...

436
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,508
before I slap you with insubordination.

437
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,844
Move, shitbird!

438
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,750
Jesus!

439
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:09,372
Detective, my office.

440
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:55,391
Base to 11-34.
Target number two is coming at your 20.

441
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:57,786
Copy that. We're on it good.

442
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:09,732
We're on the Boss.

443
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:11,969
My God.

444
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:16,811
- He shoots both?
- He kills George, right there in the store.

445
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:20,450
- Leaves the boy to bleed.
- For what?

446
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:24,613
An argument over a few cars?

447
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:28,118
- That little Polack?
- He's crazy, that one.

448
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,093
The police have him now.

449
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,397
The police still there?

450
00:45:39,202 --> 00:45:40,794
Go to the store.

451
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:45,065
Whatever the police did not take,
papers, pictures, everything...

452
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,802
you clean it up.

453
00:45:48,411 --> 00:45:51,437
The warehouse, too.
Everything gets clean now.

454
00:45:54,217 --> 00:45:55,616
Everything.

455
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,122
And the phones are dead.

456
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,829
Did you see that?
They just threw the phones.

457
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:11,491
11-34 to Surveillance.

458
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:14,367
- Standing by.
- We got our man.

459
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:18,100
Target number one
is a white male, 40s, short...

460
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:21,075
wearing a tan shirt and a gray tam.

461
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,710
Copy your description.

462
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:27,743
11-34 to Surveillance,
both targets are on the move.

463
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,479
We can't make the vehicle from here,
but you sure can.

464
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:31,576
Copy.

465
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:34,282
What was he doing
with that thing in his hand?

466
00:46:35,158 --> 00:46:37,092
Same thing you always do.

467
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:41,293
Probably sending a text message.
My kids are crazy over that.

468
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,579
That's our guy, right?

469
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,242
What's his face Sobotka
from the drug corner?

470
00:47:11,928 --> 00:47:13,987
I need to get with Vondas.

471
00:47:14,564 --> 00:47:15,929
Who's that?

472
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:24,407
Spiros. Where is he?

473
00:47:25,508 --> 00:47:27,476
I don't know no Spiros.

474
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:47,527
- No shit.
- He just up and clocked him?

475
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:50,964
- Daniels had everybody write what they saw.
- Even us suits.

476
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:53,194
That was smart. Daniels is sharp.

477
00:47:53,336 --> 00:47:55,930
- Where's Prez now?
- Daniels took him home.

478
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,167
- I don't think he'll come back to this detail.
- You never know.

479
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:02,734
He might have one of those psychological
bullshit things in his jacket...

480
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:05,110
gives him immunity or something.

481
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:09,015
Valchek gave him immunity,
and he just put Valchek on his ass.

482
00:48:12,922 --> 00:48:16,790
- Nothing since the Fort Howard meet.
- They're definitely dumping phones.

483
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:26,061
When you use a cellphone and
press "send," where does the call go to?

484
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,831
- Why are you asking?
- The Boss Man at Fort Howard.

485
00:48:28,938 --> 00:48:31,270
He tosses the cellphone we're up on, right?

486
00:48:31,374 --> 00:48:35,105
Then he pulls out another thingamajig,
and he types a message.

487
00:48:35,211 --> 00:48:36,735
Text messaging.

488
00:48:38,214 --> 00:48:42,014
It starts at one of those towers
they got up all over the place, right?

489
00:48:42,118 --> 00:48:44,882
And ends up in a computer
at a wireless provider.

490
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:49,288
If you knew when the call was made,
could you trace the call back to that tower?

491
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,993
'Cause if you could,
mightn't you get a phone number?

492
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,586
You get that,
then you got the billing details, right?

493
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:57,724
Fool, do you have any idea
how many people use cellphones?

494
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:01,326
There must be thousands,
hundreds of thousands at any time.

495
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,736
What you need is another variable.

496
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,004
Another bit of data that's gonna help you
isolate your call from all the others.

497
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:12,343
What if you knew where the call was made?
I mean, exactly where it was made.

498
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:16,949
We were out in the middle of nowhere.
Does that help narrow it down?

499
00:49:17,053 --> 00:49:21,353
The Fort Howard sea wall. It ain't exactly
Charles and Baltimore Streets.

500
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,689
You've got another problem.
Which wireless company?

501
00:49:24,794 --> 00:49:28,821
There must be Verizon, MCI, AT&T, Sprint...

502
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:32,166
Shit, tin cans and a string.
You got dozens of them.

503
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:41,942
Lamar?

504
00:49:42,912 --> 00:49:45,278
- Where's my Harper's?
- Say what?

505
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,940
Harper's. The new issue.

506
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,144
You didn't say that one.
You said The New Republic and Atlantic...

507
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:53,313
- and a new something else.
- I did not forget to tell you Harper's.

508
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:57,917
Every week I tell you the same shit,
and every week you forget half of what I say.

509
00:49:58,027 --> 00:50:01,656
Tomorrow, first thing, you go
to the newsstand and you get Harper's.

510
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:05,223
And The Nation, too,
which you also managed to forget.

511
00:50:07,036 --> 00:50:10,494
You know what the most dangerous thing
in America is, right?

512
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,635
A nigger with a library card.

513
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,672
All damn day, he just sit there reading.

514
00:50:21,951 --> 00:50:24,749
And damned if them Eastside bitches
don't stay away.

515
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:27,687
- That's real muscle, right there.
- True that.

516
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:32,317
What are we gonna do
when we start running out of good product?

517
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:34,754
That's what we need to ask ourselves.

518
00:50:34,864 --> 00:50:38,322
Yo, Bodie,
if Stringer want the Eastside up in here...

519
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,670
then why Barksdale got a man
running them off?

520
00:50:52,081 --> 00:50:55,847
This is getting us nowhere.
We got nothing under Pyramid Inc...

521
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,580
or any of the targets
at any other cellular company.

522
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,178
It's on McNulty then.

523
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:03,084
11-35, you got the 20?

524
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,060
- I'm on the spot right now.
- Go.

525
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:11,132
10-4. Latitude first:
North, 39 degrees. 11 .727.

526
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:15,766
Longitude: West, 76 degrees. 26.628.

527
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:22,170
Now, this was a neat trick.
No one ever did it before.

528
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:25,342
Identified a cellphone using time and GPS.

529
00:51:25,448 --> 00:51:28,212
We got everything on the phone
that was text messaging...

530
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,253
from those coordinates at 04:45 p.m. today.

531
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,224
Just a subpoena?

532
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:42,094
With this, you can get account information
and a phone number.

533
00:51:42,198 --> 00:51:43,722
With a search warrant...

534
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:47,462
you can get two months of text messages.

535
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,101
You got two months of text messages
in this file?

536
00:51:51,207 --> 00:51:53,334
I do, if you've got a warrant.

537
00:51:55,144 --> 00:51:56,668
Tell you what, friend.

538
00:51:56,779 --> 00:51:59,976
We're gonna go back and
start typing that warrant tomorrow morning.

539
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,483
But right now,
we wouldn't mind taking a peek...

540
00:52:02,585 --> 00:52:04,917
at what my man's been up to
in the last 24 hours.

541
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,818
Exigent circumstances.

542
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,718
Thanks, brother.

543
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,097
Fuck me.

544
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,229
Nothing's easy.

545
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,637
- What's up?
- They've dumped their phones.

546
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:33,541
We're trying to get onto
the Boss Man's text messaging.

547
00:52:35,184 --> 00:52:37,448
They sent that Greek mess over as email.

548
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:40,148
After he inputs,
the computer will translate it.

549
00:52:40,256 --> 00:52:41,280
Got it.

550
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,756
Shit.

551
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:01,510
Hey, Prissy.

552
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,111
Thought you'd be here.

553
00:53:29,572 --> 00:53:31,062
Fucking Ziggy.

554
00:53:31,941 --> 00:53:34,068
When didn't he do dumb shit?

555
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:38,374
Remember when he forged
that Age of Majority card?

556
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:42,783
We all pooled our money.

557
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:45,646
You drove us over Brooklyn Park
to the cut-rate.

558
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:47,848
My mom's puke-yellow Chevy.

559
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:50,926
We told him specifically:

560
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:53,526
two bottles of Pikesville Rye and...

561
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,233
Southern Comfort for me.

562
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,137
What did fucknuts get?

563
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,010
Fucking Boone's Farm.

564
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:16,514
He said that's what the college kids drank.

565
00:54:17,286 --> 00:54:20,050
But we did it up. Right here.

566
00:54:26,629 --> 00:54:30,087
He stood up there, a bottle in each hand...

567
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:34,263
screaming loud enough to wake the nuns.

568
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,474
What the fuck did he say?

569
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:53,015
"College kids ain't shit!"

570
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,406
Goddamn, Zig.

571
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,230
- Yeah?
- Beadie, it's Kima.

572
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,665
We're gonna take the Boss out.

573
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:50,769
- Raids? Tonight?
- You got somewhere to drop the kids off?

574
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,372
No, no problem.
I can take them over to my parents'.

575
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,743
All right, we'll see you soon.

576
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:01,017
Kima, thanks for the call. Bye.

577
00:56:13,035 --> 00:56:15,663
The judge wants to know how much longer.

578
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:16,966
We're close.

579
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:27,881
Dump this row. Dump the computer.
Dump this.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
