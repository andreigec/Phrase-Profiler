1
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:32,235
You've got to be shitting me.

2
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,299
Oh, shit!

3
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:40,927
Get over, boy!

4
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:47,031
Driving all crazy.

5
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:48,466
Damn.

6
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:18,131
16. I've got a foot Chase
on a number one male.

7
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:20,698
Maybe 13 years,
short, with braids,

8
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:23,067
in the alleys
eastbound from Fulton.

9
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:25,432
This kid has bailed out!
Bailed out!

10
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:28,264
Oh, fuck.
Fuck, fuck!

11
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,670
Officer, what are you doing?

12
00:01:31,076 --> 00:01:32,964
What you need,
bifocals or something?

13
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:34,252
What?

14
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:36,697
<i>0-9. I'm responding.</i>

15
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,465
16, 200 north.

16
00:01:39,786 --> 00:01:41,157
I'm gonna need your name.

17
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:44,182
Listen. I'm very sorry,
ma'am, all right?

18
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,421
Give me the hat.

19
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:19,462
Nah, see, them expeditions
are hard to handle.

20
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:22,096
But with a Lexus,
you have no problem.

21
00:02:31,662 --> 00:02:32,974
You little motherfuck.

22
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:34,568
You know how many cars you hit?

23
00:02:34,627 --> 00:02:35,680
What?

24
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:39,194
Don't even think
of bullshitting.

25
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:41,027
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:55,234
You know what kind of fucking
paperwork I got now, huh?

27
00:02:55,604 --> 00:02:57,512
You know how many hours
of my life you owe me,

28
00:02:57,532 --> 00:02:58,525
you little shit?

29
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:00,094
Damn, yo! That hurt!

30
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:01,649
You think that hurts.

31
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:07,535
You're so smart.

32
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,993
Let's see how easy
you boost a car now.

33
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,033
4x10 Misgivings

34
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:01,455
You imagine Rawls
sitting in this chair?

35
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,643
Never happen.
In this town?

36
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:07,655
Yeah, well, we weren't supposed
to have a white mayor, either.

37
00:05:07,722 --> 00:05:10,689
He already overreached
putting Rawls in charge.

38
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:12,271
De fucking facto.

39
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,421
Motherfucker ain't even
sworn in yet.

40
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,188
Already, he's got feelers out.

41
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,652
I know for a fact he called
the Deputy Chief in Pittsburgh--

42
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:20,805
friend of mine--

43
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:23,254
promised him pie in the sky.

44
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:24,948
Shit, partner.

45
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:28,354
All you got to do is show
Carcetti and everybody else

46
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,721
that they already got
the man for the job.

47
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:32,968
They ain't got to look
no further.

48
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:34,795
The indispensable man.

49
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:37,454
It was Royce
holding you back, Ervin.

50
00:05:37,696 --> 00:05:39,305
Now, out from under, you shine.

51
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:43,551
Clay, he's saying everything
goes through Bill Rawls.

52
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,389
Any move I try to make--

53
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,356
You're still the commissioner,
ain't you?

54
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:48,939
You give an order,
they gonna jump.

55
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:50,086
Yeah, but Carcetti--

56
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:51,466
what he gonna do, fire you?

57
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:54,353
He just showed you
he don't have balls enough.

58
00:05:57,043 --> 00:05:59,441
You just need to give Carcetti
a little something.

59
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,163
Make him start
seeing you in a new light.

60
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,311
Like what?

61
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:06,854
Some kind of police shit.
Hell, I don't know.

62
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:09,417
Something that looks good
to Carcetti,

63
00:06:09,623 --> 00:06:12,643
so he can say it was his idea
to keep you all along.

64
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:15,727
Police shit?

65
00:06:15,886 --> 00:06:18,152
Well, whatever it is
y'all do for a living.

66
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:21,289
Well--
just take care of your end

67
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:23,956
and let your friends
handle theirs.

68
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:34,215
Good morning.

69
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:36,639
I just dropped my stuff in my room,

70
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:39,349
and maintenance and Donnelly
are in there checking the heat.

71
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:41,376
It must be 80 degrees in there.

72
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,541
90-minute classes.

73
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:45,359
Excuse me?

74
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:48,184
This time of the year,
we go to 90-minute classes.

75
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:51,421
Concentrated prep in math
and language arts only.

76
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:54,898
I don't follow.
Why the heat?

77
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:59,030
It's the only way the kids will sit
through 90 minutes of anything.

78
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:00,997
Make them drowsy?

79
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:02,431
Right.

80
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,842
So it's about the tests.

81
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:07,583
From now until they're done,
everything's about the tests.

82
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:14,788
Damn!

83
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:17,234
I ought to go somewhere warm
for the winter.

84
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:18,842
Where?

85
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:22,620
I saw on animal planet
marlin fishing--

86
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:25,560
like, Florida, the Bahamas.

87
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:27,737
That shit looked sweet.

88
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:32,627
The water was like this...
this color, man.

89
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:35,309
Man, it ain't gonna be
that color this year.

90
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:36,783
How you know?

91
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,072
Global warming.

92
00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:40,050
So why is it so cold already?

93
00:07:40,452 --> 00:07:42,816
Yo, we just getting old.

94
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:44,975
Yeah. True that.

95
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,048
Where the fuck you been?

96
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:50,408
City jail
for a day and a half

97
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:51,981
till they recog me.

98
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:55,494
Then my grandma got sick,
so I was over there for a while.

99
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:57,559
Popo hit you with a charge, huh?

100
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:00,248
Just a humble--
false statement and shit,

101
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:02,394
for saying I wasn't
who I really was.

102
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:05,832
Damn, dude. Why they was
asking about you like that?

103
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:08,874
They try talking to you?

104
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:10,948
Yeah, about some murder.

105
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:13,170
- Which one?
- It don't matter which murder

106
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:15,813
because I didn't say shit
to them bitches, though.

107
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:18,964
Yeah, well, I ain't the one
you need to convince.

108
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,947
Why I got to convince him?

109
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:26,080
You know, I'm saying, yo.

110
00:08:26,147 --> 00:08:28,865
Popo come asking about you,
they snatch your ass up,

111
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:30,840
you out of pocket for a few days.

112
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:33,848
Oh, yeah.
He'll definitely hear about it.

113
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:35,714
I ain't say nothing to nobody.

114
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,753
That's why they
gave me the humble,

115
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,680
dumped my ass
in central booking,

116
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:42,071
because I ain't say
a fucking word to none of them.

117
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:43,780
Yeah, so go tell him that shit.

118
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:47,042
Shit, man, if it were me,
I'd go to him first.

119
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,555
Yeah, Definitely jump out
in front of that, man,

120
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:51,398
because if they got to come
looking for you,

121
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,132
it's gonna look
you got something to hide.

122
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:54,205
Definitely.

123
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:57,449
Get up here on a special.
Two for one.

124
00:08:58,843 --> 00:08:59,955
What you want?

125
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:01,979
Menu, yo.
Give him a menu.

126
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:06,929
What's good?

127
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:08,978
Fuck if I know.

128
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:11,615
You ain't supposed to cuss
at the customer, motherfucker.

129
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:13,830
Kwame. Darnell.

130
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:15,262
All right.

131
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:17,998
Let me get... pizza.

132
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:20,412
Pizza. Anything to drink?

133
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,014
Grape soda.

134
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:23,779
Quiet, please.

135
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,062
Is that it?

136
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:26,312
Yeah.

137
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:28,044
Thank you.
Say "thank you."

138
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:29,534
Yeah. Thank you.

139
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:31,519
Menu?

140
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,090
Don't he got to say
"thank you," too?

141
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,144
Darnell.

142
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:37,697
What the fuck for?
He's supposed to give it back.

143
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,281
Because when you are polite to
people, they treat you better.

144
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:41,929
- Have a seat, please.
- May I see you?

145
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,694
Now, you try being the waiter,
and, Albert, be the customer.

146
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:49,463
What you want to eat?

147
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:51,302
Give me some crab cakes
and a coke.

148
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,502
Hurry that shit up, too.

149
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:56,343
They're on the phone nonstop
on fourth avenue.

150
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,210
They're insisting,
every class teaches to the test.

151
00:09:59,276 --> 00:10:00,564
Oh, God.

152
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:03,243
Look. I thought
we were the exception.

153
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,450
I mean, that's the point of the project.
They know that.

154
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:08,177
No exceptions.

155
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:11,349
And 90-minute blocks of math
or language arts only.

156
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,943
This class?

157
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:15,326
Kids can't do 30 minutes
without climbing the walls.

158
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:17,453
Isn't there somebody
we can sit down and talk with,

159
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,442
face to face?

160
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:20,547
Actually, that's
the second thing they told me.

161
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:24,173
The area superintendent wants to
see the two of you tomorrow morning.

162
00:10:24,678 --> 00:10:26,327
9:00 in the conference room.

163
00:10:31,622 --> 00:10:34,503
Let's not panic... yet.

164
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,710
Business as usual.

165
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,385
Marlo.

166
00:10:57,842 --> 00:10:59,716
You don't know him
when we robbed the game.

167
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:01,584
He ain't that bad a dude.

168
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:04,842
Boy's merely a name to me.

169
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:10,640
If you knew it was Marlo,

170
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:12,801
you'd still
go through with it, no?

171
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:16,707
I wish I'd have known.
I'd have enjoyed it that much more.

172
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:30,006
Bubs.

173
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:33,152
It's Herc. You hungry?

174
00:11:34,663 --> 00:11:36,630
Yo, what you done
was fucked up, man.

175
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,871
You don't know how bad
I felt when I heard.

176
00:11:38,962 --> 00:11:41,367
I mean, not only was you late,
you just walked right past.

177
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:42,986
Ain't you see me getting beat?

178
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,151
We rolled by?

179
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:47,206
I seen you with
the blue light on, man.

180
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:50,272
Whatever. Look.
We had a communication problem, I admit.

181
00:11:50,603 --> 00:11:53,806
But I'm gonna get you a phone today,
and that's gonna solve it for us.

182
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:55,323
You'll see.

183
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:59,138
Thing is,
there's this camera--

184
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:02,904
police department video camera
disappeared a few weeks back.

185
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:05,748
And for various reasons
that I can't get into,

186
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,513
I got to get it back somehow.

187
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,198
Camera?

188
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:12,782
Yeah. This fella Marlo probably took it.
I don't know if he hocked it or if he--

189
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,691
You're bothering me
about a camera?

190
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,672
You supposed to have my back,
remember?

191
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:17,997
5 minutes, you told me.

192
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:20,044
I know. I owe on the deal.

193
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:24,705
It's Tyrone's, chicken wings.

194
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:34,470
Here's the thing.

195
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:35,943
I want you to put it out there

196
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,151
that there's a $500 bounty
on this camera if it comes back.

197
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:41,571
No questions asked.

198
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:42,943
500?

199
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,388
Swear to God.
I'm good for it

200
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:45,903
if it's the right camera.

201
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:49,055
Here's the model
and serial number.

202
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:52,696
So it's 500 for the camera
and a chicken box for Bubs, huh?

203
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:55,103
It's another hundred to you
if this happens.

204
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:57,379
But I need this camera quick,
or shit's gonna fly.

205
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:58,546
Look, man.

206
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,936
I told you, it's not about
the money for me right now.

207
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,001
All right? This motherfucker,
He messing with my livelihood here.

208
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:06,119
They're always coming back,
always.

209
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:08,376
He's like some Terminator and shit.

210
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:09,436
I'm with you.

211
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,153
I'm gonna do everything I can
to help you out with your problem,

212
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:13,984
and you're gonna help me out
with mine.

213
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:26,685
Who the fuck is Randy?

214
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:29,451
He's a little hopper
from around the way.

215
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:32,569
He ain't in the game,
but he be with Michael and them.

216
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:34,236
And he talking to police?

217
00:13:34,376 --> 00:13:36,163
I know it.
I know he did,

218
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:37,414
because he was the one I told,

219
00:13:37,454 --> 00:13:38,944
"Go tell Lex
to go up to the alley.

220
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:40,067
Patrice is waiting."

221
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,545
You were supposed to do that.

222
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:42,835
Yeah, I know, but this way,

223
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:46,073
try to keep some distance
between me and Lex, right?

224
00:13:49,988 --> 00:13:51,975
You tell Randy
what happened to Lex?

225
00:13:52,638 --> 00:13:54,386
No, I swear it.

226
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:03,100
Go, motherfucker.
The fuck you still waiting for?

227
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:11,377
What the fuck y'all
following me for?

228
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:12,499
Easy, son.

229
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:14,823
No. Ain't nobody
walking with me nowhere.

230
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:39,143
What's up with this Randy?

231
00:14:39,242 --> 00:14:40,447
He can't hurt us.

232
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:41,878
He a snitch, though.

233
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,766
Yeah. Put that around, then.

234
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:44,898
Slim.

235
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:46,265
Marlo.

236
00:14:46,662 --> 00:14:47,655
How you feeling?

237
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:48,907
Can't complain, yo.

238
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,638
Getting to be that time, though.

239
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,866
Joe wanted me to check in,
you know?

240
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:57,897
All right. Pull up a chair
and shop it up.

241
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:01,917
Now, that there a Barksdale boy.

242
00:15:03,116 --> 00:15:04,328
So?

243
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:07,447
Don't add up.

244
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:10,864
Interesting, though.

245
00:15:29,654 --> 00:15:30,945
Got a burner, see?

246
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:33,997
If anything else comes up,
you call me.

247
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:36,764
If this guy robs you again,
make sure he's holding.

248
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,062
The more, the better.

249
00:15:38,142 --> 00:15:39,996
Shit. I ain't got money for all that.

250
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:51,929
There's 40 minutes on that,
and my number's in there already.

251
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,377
Watch. I'm gonna call you today
or tomorrow at the latest.

252
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:01,811
One and one.

253
00:16:02,388 --> 00:16:04,496
Damn, son.
He did a number on you.

254
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:05,929
Who was it?

255
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:07,469
Officer Walker.

256
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:09,879
Walker be evil.

257
00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:12,761
What up?

258
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,953
4.

259
00:16:16,482 --> 00:16:18,055
Yeah, we ought to fuck him up.

260
00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:20,328
Walker? Yo, he the police.

261
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:21,729
I'm just saying.

262
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,595
Said next time
I steal a car,

263
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:25,295
I'm gonna find myself dead.

264
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:26,873
You gonna do as he say?

265
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:28,462
Fuck, no.

266
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,095
Soon as I get this shit off,

267
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:32,342
I'll be running his ass
all over town.

268
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:34,229
Yo, shit!

269
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:39,627
Told you, Namond.

270
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:41,679
Gave you fair warning, didn't I?

271
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:42,817
I ain't done nothing.

272
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:44,983
Get the cash.
Got you cold.

273
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,592
With hair like that,
I could make you from east Baltimore.

274
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:49,860
- Get the fuck off of me, man.
- Shut up!

275
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:55,394
Look what I found.

276
00:16:55,751 --> 00:16:58,159
- That ain't fucking mine!
- Hands on the car.

277
00:16:58,373 --> 00:16:59,625
Spread legs.

278
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:02,630
- I ain't fucking got--
- Shut up!

279
00:17:05,377 --> 00:17:07,463
How you like it so far?
Having fun?

280
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:10,148
Guess what? Gets better.

281
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:12,526
Give me your hands.

282
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:18,144
Watch your head.

283
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,924
Damn. Y'all not
wasting any time, huh?

284
00:17:27,149 --> 00:17:30,826
Reese was good enough to let us stage in
the council suite till the inauguration.

285
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:33,707
No doubt after your fine
showing in the general.

286
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:35,769
- No doubt.
- 81%?

287
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,041
82.

288
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:40,648
In a city where democrats
outnumber republicans 9 to 1.

289
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,251
Anything less would have been
an embarrassment.

290
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,202
So...

291
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,168
what can we do for you, Senator?

292
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:53,444
Well, first of all,
I wanted to clear the air.

293
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:57,259
If there are any hard feelings
over what happened during the primary--

294
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,057
You gonna give the money back?

295
00:18:02,855 --> 00:18:05,418
Senator, it's been a very long day.

296
00:18:05,796 --> 00:18:07,246
I'll cut to the Chase.

297
00:18:08,693 --> 00:18:12,244
I understand you have a problem
at the top of the police department.

298
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,363
You asked Burrell to resign.
He declined.

299
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:18,500
I'm looking for a replacement.

300
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,989
The ministers like Burrell.
So does the Council President.

301
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:25,724
We're confident that when
we identify a suitable candidate,

302
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:30,189
Ms. Campbell and the ministers
will see the wisdom of new leadership.

303
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:34,673
Except y'all need to get a pay raise
through the city council.

304
00:18:35,258 --> 00:18:36,450
Pay raise would help.

305
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:40,561
I can ask Nerese about
that pay raise getting passed.

306
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:42,758
Maybe convince
some of the ministers

307
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:45,670
they...
need to move on from Burrell.

308
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:52,782
Situation would have to be
resolved sooner rather than later.

309
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:55,946
Do my best, partner.

310
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:59,122
And what do we do for you in return?

311
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:02,538
I'm in Annapolis.

312
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:06,808
Word I'm hearing, you may be there, too,
in a couple of years.

313
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,963
We may find ourselves
working together closely.

314
00:19:11,728 --> 00:19:13,088
Thanks for your time.

315
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,049
Jesus Christ.

316
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:20,820
He's slick.

317
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:23,621
Apologizes for the short con,

318
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:26,576
and then in the next breath
setting us up for the long.

319
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:28,508
He and Burrell are as thick as thieves.

320
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:30,282
And do we know
what the long con is?

321
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:32,253
At least we know he's running one.

322
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:35,520
Shi...

323
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,679
try calling again.

324
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:47,267
Man, I know she not gonna answer.

325
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:49,520
My mom's don't answer
when she go to A.C.

326
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:50,886
When she coming back?

327
00:19:51,234 --> 00:19:52,784
She going to New York after.

328
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:54,761
What's she doing in new York?

329
00:19:55,386 --> 00:19:56,519
Shopping.

330
00:19:56,878 --> 00:19:58,944
Going to see some show,
"the color purple."

331
00:20:01,194 --> 00:20:04,691
See, now,
this is where my job gets good.

332
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,449
You could reach a guardian,

333
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:08,524
we both know the juvenile
master's gonna recog you

334
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:09,963
on a first-time drug arrest.

335
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:13,320
But now, you'd better have
a toothbrush on you, son,

336
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,486
because it's gonna be
baby booking tonight.

337
00:20:23,194 --> 00:20:24,485
Namond, you scared?

338
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:28,715
I mean, if it was Cheltenham,
I don't blame you,

339
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:30,722
but baby booking's
just across town.

340
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:34,626
The east side be beefing
with the west side in there.

341
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:38,175
There's some dudes
be getting raped and shit.

342
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:41,314
I mean,
that's what I be hearing.

343
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,450
It's bad in there.
I don't know if it's that bad.

344
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,497
Well, I hear different.

345
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,720
You got no other family?

346
00:20:58,773 --> 00:21:00,617
I got a aunt
down in P.G. County.

347
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:02,075
You got a number?

348
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:06,977
Well, I ain't driving you
this late, anyway, so--

349
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:08,304
Come on, man.

350
00:21:17,832 --> 00:21:19,064
Tell you what.

351
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:21,647
Two of my guys
are working a double,

352
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:23,402
working midnight shift tonight.

353
00:21:24,138 --> 00:21:26,340
If you can plant yourself
on that bench over there,

354
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,717
you can stay here for the night.

355
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:30,408
But first thing tomorrow,
you got to raise that aunt

356
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:33,091
or raise your moms,
or I got to process you.

357
00:21:39,004 --> 00:21:40,382
You don't move off that bench.

358
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,262
You need the bathroom,
you go now.

359
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,082
Otherwise, just...
sit tight,

360
00:21:45,356 --> 00:21:48,356
don't give anybody any trouble, or they'll
process you right then and there.

361
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,422
I'm cool. Thanks.

362
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,249
Fucking charity ward here.

363
00:21:56,742 --> 00:21:58,471
I'll go tell
the shift commander.

364
00:22:02,094 --> 00:22:03,247
Yo, Lieutenant.

365
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,614
He a fed?

366
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:15,719
No.
Probably copping it from my moms.

367
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,045
That's why?

368
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:20,614
Look. I told y'all,

369
00:22:21,753 --> 00:22:23,080
I just want him gone.

370
00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:25,412
I just want him away
from me and bug.

371
00:22:25,626 --> 00:22:27,255
The fuck he do to you?

372
00:22:34,912 --> 00:22:36,104
All right.

373
00:22:36,842 --> 00:22:38,451
We'll take care of it, boss.

374
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:52,212
Another church burglary
in sector two last night.

375
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:53,760
Madison park Methodist.

376
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:55,679
This would be what you'd call a rash.

377
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:57,179
And we could use some ointment.

378
00:22:57,521 --> 00:23:00,910
We need to arrest these fucks.
We getting anywhere on that?

379
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:01,942
Not yet.

380
00:23:01,962 --> 00:23:04,150
Who caught the last one?
Mcnulty?

381
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:06,474
Working it. We should talk.

382
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:08,313
- All right.
- Speaking of arrests,

383
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:10,306
word from on high
is to sweep corners.

384
00:23:10,485 --> 00:23:12,674
They want arrests to double
over the next month.

385
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,713
Jesus, I thought the election was over.

386
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:17,680
Bosses want quality-of-life violations.

387
00:23:17,877 --> 00:23:19,932
What are we talking about,
Lieutenant, loitering?

388
00:23:19,954 --> 00:23:21,597
Disorderlies,
public indecency.

389
00:23:21,677 --> 00:23:22,883
Oh, this is horse shit.

390
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:24,813
- Broken windows theory.
- Worked in New York.

391
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,663
Case you ain't noticed,
this ain't New York.

392
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,795
But it could work here.

393
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:29,623
- Never has.
- Never been done right.

394
00:23:29,703 --> 00:23:32,255
- Open containers, too.
- What's wrong with writing a ticket?

395
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:33,806
Gonna be doing more of that, too.

396
00:23:33,865 --> 00:23:36,410
The word is, the Commissioner himself
wants to juke arrests.

397
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,097
Open container used to be
sacrosanct in this town.

398
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:40,533
Long as it was in a paper bag.

399
00:23:40,592 --> 00:23:42,091
They gave you that much respect.

400
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,003
Man's beverage was his business.

401
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:46,510
You took them to a restaurant?

402
00:23:46,612 --> 00:23:48,142
Yeah. Ruth's Chris.

403
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,677
Linen napkins.

404
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:52,177
Yeah. Silverware,
more than one fork.

405
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,607
How'd they do?

406
00:23:55,706 --> 00:23:57,395
Eh, pretty well, considering.

407
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,452
Did they embarrass us?

408
00:23:59,866 --> 00:24:03,235
Us? No.
We're fine with it, But...

409
00:24:04,514 --> 00:24:06,315
I mean, they were
intimidated, embarrassed,

410
00:24:06,395 --> 00:24:07,927
and awkward as hell,

411
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:09,639
but they made it through.

412
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:11,580
Ms. Shepherdson,
these aren't the kids

413
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,067
that are gonna be able to sit
still for the statewide tests,

414
00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:15,474
Much less do well on them.

415
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,643
These kids are gonna make it impossible
for anyone else to do well.

416
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,813
So we're writing them off?

417
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:23,076
No, that's what we're not doing.

418
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,842
You're not educating them.
You're socializing them.

419
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:27,299
They weren't being educated before.

420
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,650
There's no point in being obtuse.

421
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,606
- Excuse me.
- Hold on. Hold on.

422
00:24:31,182 --> 00:24:32,974
Look. What he's saying is this.

423
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:35,325
I mean, you put a textbook
in front of these kids,

424
00:24:35,537 --> 00:24:36,887
put a problem on a blackboard or,

425
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:38,945
teach them every problem
on some statewide test,

426
00:24:38,992 --> 00:24:40,663
it won't matter, none of it,

427
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:44,195
'cause they're not learning for
our world; They're learning for theirs.

428
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,247
They know exactly
what it is they're training for

429
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:48,309
and what it is everyone
expects them to be.

430
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:50,713
I expect them to be students.

431
00:24:50,752 --> 00:24:54,185
But it's not about you or us,
or the tests or the system.

432
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:56,907
It's what they expect of themselves.

433
00:24:57,271 --> 00:25:00,180
I mean, every single one of them
know they headed back to the corners.

434
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:02,407
Their brothers and sisters--
shit, their parents--

435
00:25:02,748 --> 00:25:05,110
they came through these
same classrooms, didn't they?

436
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:07,515
We pretended to teach them,
they pretended to learn,

437
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:09,374
and where--
where'd they end up?

438
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:11,076
Same damn corners.

439
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:14,910
I mean, they're not fools,
these kids.

440
00:25:15,565 --> 00:25:18,187
They don't know our world,
but they know their own.

441
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,359
I mean, Jesus, they--

442
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:22,819
They see right through us.

443
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,004
I think we made that clear
when you approved the project.

444
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,949
Provisionally approved.

445
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,035
When you provisionally
approved the project,

446
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:34,389
we made it clear that we
would be addressing children

447
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:36,018
that required socialization

448
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:37,687
before they could be
properly educated.

449
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:38,979
We can't lie.

450
00:25:41,318 --> 00:25:42,550
Not to them.

451
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:46,078
<i>Captain, line 3.</i>

452
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:52,772
Roll call's over.

453
00:25:58,632 --> 00:26:00,321
You get a line
on your mother yet?

454
00:26:02,498 --> 00:26:04,472
Fucking neglect case here,
I want it.

455
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:07,986
How about that aunt?

456
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:13,970
Ain't nobody else you know?
No other responsible adult?

457
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:15,384
Like who?

458
00:26:15,444 --> 00:26:16,565
I don't know.

459
00:26:16,615 --> 00:26:18,514
I'm just trying to give you
one last shot here

460
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:20,128
because once I go
on the street today,

461
00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:21,870
you're gonna
have to go to booking.

462
00:26:24,731 --> 00:26:25,962
I got a teacher.

463
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:28,095
Mr. Colvin. You know him?

464
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:29,795
He used to be police.

465
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:31,659
Tall? Bald?

466
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:33,354
Yeah.

467
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:36,490
Yeah, I know him.

468
00:26:37,627 --> 00:26:39,003
What if you get the one snitch?

469
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:41,172
The one with the cart.
What's his name?

470
00:26:41,272 --> 00:26:42,334
Bubbles.

471
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,704
Bubbles. Yeah.

472
00:26:44,056 --> 00:26:46,170
You get Bubbles to say
he's fuzzy Dunlop.

473
00:26:46,236 --> 00:26:49,078
Except Bubbles has been
a registered C.I. for years.

474
00:26:49,197 --> 00:26:51,903
Kima gave him a number back
when she was in plainclothes, man.

475
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,615
And, Herc, you worked with him under
that number On the Barksdale stuff.

476
00:26:55,734 --> 00:26:57,536
So how would you
fuck up the I.D.?

477
00:26:57,838 --> 00:26:59,288
Fuck me, man.

478
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:03,169
Look. The only way
to get out from under this

479
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:05,572
is to stop fucking lying, OK?

480
00:27:06,172 --> 00:27:08,960
You grab your dick,
you walk into Marimow's office,

481
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,536
and you say,
"Lieutenant, I made a mistake.

482
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:16,135
"I attributed my P.C. to an informant
when in fact I had it off a camera."

483
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:19,302
That I got from I.S.D. without
going through the proper channels.

484
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:21,703
No, no.
He's gonna take my stripes on this.

485
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:23,101
Look. Maybe he does,

486
00:27:23,168 --> 00:27:25,698
but if you wait until I.S.D.
Comes looking for that camera

487
00:27:25,738 --> 00:27:27,721
and he figures out the lie for himself,

488
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,487
he takes your fucking balls.

489
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:42,134
Come on!

490
00:27:42,513 --> 00:27:43,599
Let's go!

491
00:27:43,738 --> 00:27:45,101
Test 'em out around the corner.

492
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:55,228
Got you now, motherfucker.

493
00:28:00,816 --> 00:28:02,302
In going over
some of my paperwork,

494
00:28:02,362 --> 00:28:04,400
it occurs to me
I may have been neglectful.

495
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:06,743
Look at all this crap!

496
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:08,659
Every day,

497
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,500
more and more of
Lester Freamon's bullshit

498
00:28:11,678 --> 00:28:13,169
Washes up with us.

499
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:17,840
What the fuck are you saying?

500
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,866
That my paperwork
may have been a little sloppy,

501
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,946
and as a result,
I confused myself on some things.

502
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,249
No shit, you were sloppy.

503
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:29,199
I actually went back a couple
weeks on your run sheets.

504
00:28:30,104 --> 00:28:32,533
Nothing there references
a meet with a C.I. 238.

505
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:35,290
- You went through all my run sheets?
- The best I could.

506
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:40,523
- Sir, listen--
- I don't care who it is.

507
00:28:40,562 --> 00:28:41,754
Turn that fucking thing off.

508
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:46,882
I am starting to believe

509
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,869
that this fuzzy fella
doesn't exist.

510
00:28:53,926 --> 00:28:55,459
I am starting to believe

511
00:28:55,618 --> 00:28:58,964
that you just followed Stanfield
into the train station

512
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:02,026
and grabbed the first broad
he brushed up against.

513
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:03,955
That what happened?

514
00:29:03,995 --> 00:29:05,431
No. No, sir.

515
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:06,912
You lie to me now, Sergeant,

516
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:09,396
and I guaran-fucking-tee you
I will jam you up,

517
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,059
ship this whole mess to I.I.D.

518
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,525
and be there to pass out
sandwiches at your execution.

519
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:14,674
Yes, sir.

520
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:17,853
You haven't brought me
a case yet worth talking about.

521
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,574
Not on Marlo Stanfield,
not on anyone.

522
00:29:21,796 --> 00:29:25,571
You bring me something
other than I.I.D. Complaints,

523
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:29,226
and I might have some reason
to let a few things slide.

524
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,117
Mad at me?

525
00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:37,196
Dukie's just mad
at everything.

526
00:29:39,229 --> 00:29:40,663
Snitch bitch.

527
00:29:42,174 --> 00:29:43,545
Yo, what the fuck was that?

528
00:29:44,402 --> 00:29:45,574
I don't know.

529
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,023
I can't believe
y'all are doing this shit.

530
00:30:05,063 --> 00:30:07,429
You're degrading the quality
of life in this neighborhood.

531
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,796
- Malt liquor.
- Oh, come on, man!

532
00:30:10,077 --> 00:30:12,203
Brother, you got to shake hands
with a pilsner,

533
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:14,193
maybe a nice tail ale.

534
00:30:14,253 --> 00:30:16,075
Hell, what-- Oh, man!
My brew!

535
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:17,361
My shoes!

536
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,964
God! Man.

537
00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:20,489
What's the violation?

538
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:23,094
Parking in a bus stop,
expired registration.

539
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:24,885
First-Class police work, baker.

540
00:30:25,163 --> 00:30:27,294
Yeah, well, this is the word
from up on high,

541
00:30:27,569 --> 00:30:29,375
straight from the eighth floor downtown.

542
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:32,061
Blessed bosses juking stats
for the new administration.

543
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,506
I know you think it's bullshit,

544
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,493
but I spend my shift
where they tell me.

545
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:38,155
Baker, let me tell you
a little secret.

546
00:30:38,747 --> 00:30:42,710
A patrolling officer on his beat
is the one true dictatorship in America.

547
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,991
We can lock a guy up on a humble;

548
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:46,342
we can lock him up for real;

549
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:47,760
or we can say, fuck it,

550
00:30:47,957 --> 00:30:50,593
pull under the expressway,
and drink ourselves to death.

551
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:52,726
And our side partners
will cover it.

552
00:30:53,057 --> 00:30:57,150
So no one, and I mean no one,
tells us how to waste our shift.

553
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:02,065
Pulled the reports
on those church burglaries.

554
00:31:02,104 --> 00:31:03,138
Yeah?

555
00:31:03,178 --> 00:31:04,450
Yeah. There's a pattern.

556
00:31:06,144 --> 00:31:07,515
Times and locations.

557
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,219
They're working west by northwest
through Sandtown-Winchester.

558
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,430
The last 3--
Here, here, and here--

559
00:31:13,477 --> 00:31:15,612
these ones in blue
are the churches they haven't hit

560
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:16,844
closest to the ones they have.

561
00:31:16,868 --> 00:31:18,604
You got all this
from the incident reports?

562
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,074
That's why we do the paperwork.

563
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:26,392
Are you out of your motherfucking mind?

564
00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:27,967
I live here, man!

565
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,559
This could get out of hand.

566
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,638
That's what we want, isn't it?
More arrests?

567
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:32,750
Come on.

568
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:42,301
No justice, no peace.

569
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:53,101
It'll only be for tonight.

570
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,391
Mama gets back from New York tomorrow.

571
00:31:58,176 --> 00:31:59,257
Your call.

572
00:32:03,908 --> 00:32:05,955
The young man seems
to think highly of you, boss.

573
00:32:06,034 --> 00:32:08,498
He invoked your name
with a measure of respect.

574
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:10,545
It wasn't but a few weeks ago

575
00:32:10,605 --> 00:32:13,981
I was in a room with him being
called everything but a child of God.

576
00:32:14,609 --> 00:32:16,139
"Mr. Colvin, sir.

577
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:17,760
Fuck you."

578
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,474
Yeah, well, at least
I said, "mister."

579
00:32:27,464 --> 00:32:29,723
- So what was the charge?
- Slinging.

580
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:31,887
They've been out there
a few weeks or so.

581
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:34,251
First pop,
second warning from me.

582
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,931
Maybe you should put him
on the juvenile bus.

583
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:39,946
He wants so bad
to be a gangster,

584
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,501
maybe it's time he get a taste of what
a real lock-up's all about, you know?

585
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,356
Come on, Mr. C.,
don't do me like that.

586
00:32:45,593 --> 00:32:47,789
I made him sleep on the D.E.U.
bench last night,

587
00:32:48,158 --> 00:32:49,688
if that counts for anything.

588
00:32:51,152 --> 00:32:52,443
Isn't there anybody else?

589
00:32:52,956 --> 00:32:54,455
I mean, friend, relative, anybody?

590
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:56,996
You've always been good
with the knuckleheads, boss.

591
00:33:05,018 --> 00:33:06,722
All right.
Let me go call my wife.

592
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:29,321
Yeah.
Go up in that building.

593
00:33:39,745 --> 00:33:40,996
That was delicious.

594
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:42,504
There's more.

595
00:33:42,742 --> 00:33:44,886
No, ma'am.
Saving room for the cobbler.

596
00:33:45,095 --> 00:33:46,153
A la mode?

597
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:49,601
Would you like ice cream on it?

598
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,282
Yes, ma'am.

599
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:53,891
Nice manners.

600
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:56,847
From what you told me
on the phone, Bunny,

601
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,783
I was expecting
more of an adventure.

602
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,156
Bunny?

603
00:34:09,196 --> 00:34:10,905
Only my friends call me Bunny.

604
00:34:11,325 --> 00:34:12,460
Yeah, but why?

605
00:34:12,698 --> 00:34:14,069
You don't need to know.

606
00:34:16,103 --> 00:34:19,401
And if you tell anybody,
I'll cut your balls off.

607
00:34:22,683 --> 00:34:25,346
I'll cut them off,
give 'em to Donnelly in a jar.

608
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,150
Don't doubt me, boy.

609
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,284
You ain't got no kids?

610
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:36,649
Grown.

611
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,556
They're at college
and passing.

612
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,907
You told me
these kids were rough.

613
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,103
Thank you, sweetie.
But don't be fooled.

614
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,927
This is his Eddie Haskell act.

615
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:57,046
Eddie Haskell?
Who that?

616
00:34:58,226 --> 00:35:01,226
You are, son.
Trust me.

617
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:05,260
Take a seat.

618
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,528
Put yours against the wall
with the others.

619
00:35:08,568 --> 00:35:10,157
...on their way back
from booking.

620
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:11,936
No, we need the key
to the interview room.

621
00:35:11,975 --> 00:35:13,982
- What the fuck for?
- Felony burglary.

622
00:35:14,618 --> 00:35:15,651
Felony?

623
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:19,859
Caught them coming
out of St. Martin's on Fulton.

624
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,182
Charging them with the one,

625
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:23,109
but we might work back
on a few more.

626
00:35:23,229 --> 00:35:24,366
No shit?

627
00:35:24,702 --> 00:35:27,649
Fucking knew there was still some
real criminals left in Baltimore.

628
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,962
Swear to God, I'm seeing
citations for jaywalking.

629
00:35:33,437 --> 00:35:35,665
We're locking people up
for open container,

630
00:35:35,824 --> 00:35:37,915
for disorderly, for loitering.

631
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:39,300
The neighborhood people,

632
00:35:39,379 --> 00:35:41,614
sometimes they appreciate
quality-of-life arrests.

633
00:35:41,732 --> 00:35:43,796
Except we're locking up
the neighborhood people.

634
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:46,381
Some of my guys,
all they see are the stats.

635
00:35:46,695 --> 00:35:48,531
I mean, the election's
fucking over, right?

636
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,061
Who are we doing this for?

637
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:53,117
Is this coming
from Burrell or Rawls?

638
00:35:53,197 --> 00:35:55,048
We got it from the chief of patrol.

639
00:35:55,523 --> 00:35:57,037
It's rolling downhill, for sure.

640
00:35:57,136 --> 00:35:59,447
- Morale?
- Split down the middle, I'd say.

641
00:35:59,645 --> 00:36:01,472
The officers that love the stat
are jazzed.

642
00:36:01,551 --> 00:36:02,914
The rest of you?

643
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:04,636
We don't know where to turn.

644
00:36:05,058 --> 00:36:07,813
I thought a new hump as mayor
might change this shit,

645
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:09,213
not ramp it up.

646
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:12,380
Hey, you still fucking that bitch?

647
00:36:12,913 --> 00:36:14,515
Yeah. It burning like hell, man.

648
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,893
- And you gonna burn the bitch back.
- Oh. Check it.

649
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,014
Slim.

650
00:36:20,193 --> 00:36:22,227
- B. What up?
- All right.

651
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:23,614
- Poot.
- It's good.

652
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,051
Heard you're out.

653
00:36:25,171 --> 00:36:26,263
Yeah.

654
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:28,060
Welcome home.

655
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:29,291
Thanks, Dawg.

656
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,477
And you with prop Joe now.

657
00:36:32,147 --> 00:36:33,379
Never would have thought.

658
00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:36,045
Yeah, well, life's strange.

659
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:39,601
Yeah. Holler.

660
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:43,251
Bodie...
how you and Marlo?

661
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:46,836
You OK with him?

662
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,777
As far as I know, yeah.
Why?

663
00:36:51,093 --> 00:36:52,484
What he did to your boy.

664
00:36:53,142 --> 00:36:54,346
What boy are you talking?

665
00:36:54,768 --> 00:36:55,933
Big boy,

666
00:36:56,032 --> 00:36:58,436
the one rub s hands together
all the time?

667
00:36:58,947 --> 00:37:00,437
Kevin?
What about him?

668
00:37:01,091 --> 00:37:02,278
You ain't heard?

669
00:37:02,664 --> 00:37:04,790
Chris and Snoop walked him
down an alley.

670
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:07,437
He in a vacant now.

671
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,378
How you know that?

672
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:12,220
I seen them lay hands on the boy.

673
00:37:13,027 --> 00:37:14,974
And now the word out in the street.

674
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:19,978
Sorry, Dawg.

675
00:37:24,505 --> 00:37:25,558
Let's roll.

676
00:37:34,884 --> 00:37:37,547
Plymouth rock.
Got that Plymouth rock.

677
00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:45,341
All right.

678
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,942
So now look at the next
example question on page 20.

679
00:37:49,209 --> 00:37:50,443
As you can see...

680
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,909
if you turn to page 20,

681
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,376
they will sometimes ask you

682
00:37:55,443 --> 00:37:58,310
for words that are the opposite
of words that are underlined.

683
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,642
Thank you, Mr. Pryzbylewski.

684
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:01,925
Thank you.

685
00:38:06,138 --> 00:38:08,065
All right, put away
your test notebooks.

686
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:09,758
Work on those tomorrow.

687
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:14,612
We have, 45 minutes left.

688
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:16,122
We can do
<i>Last of the Mohicans--/i

689
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,178
Or practice probabilities.

690
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:22,499
- I'll get the stuff, Mr. Prezbo.
- All right.

691
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:26,785
And I want to see
everybody's worksheets out.

692
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:28,640
Hey, Kareem,
want to play dice with me?

693
00:38:28,699 --> 00:38:29,827
Not with you.

694
00:38:31,472 --> 00:38:33,518
And we're not just
playing games here.

695
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:35,042
We're doing math.

696
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,441
I'll roll with you, man.
Come on.

697
00:38:37,768 --> 00:38:40,033
No kidding.
We are.

698
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:09,473
That's my boy resting his head, see?

699
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,577
Hey, Renaldo,
you want a coddie?

700
00:39:19,262 --> 00:39:21,587
- No.
- They're from Faidley's, yo.

701
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:24,473
He might stay home all day, you know?

702
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:26,240
We gonna find out, ain't we?

703
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,351
Like to see about my D.S.S. Code.

704
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:36,488
Do you have an appointment?

705
00:39:36,524 --> 00:39:37,557
Why I need an appointment?

706
00:39:37,568 --> 00:39:39,536
Zenobia, I don't think
she needs an appointment.

707
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:41,253
Sorry.
Just trying to make it realistic.

708
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,559
So I get to see somebody?

709
00:39:42,921 --> 00:39:44,304
You've to take a number and wait.

710
00:39:44,344 --> 00:39:45,734
I need to see somebody right now.

711
00:39:45,773 --> 00:39:47,642
Don't get angry.
Anger doesn't help.

712
00:39:47,701 --> 00:39:49,123
It just makes people defensive.

713
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:50,739
Tell her what you need calmly.

714
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,174
- Card didn't come this month.
- We mailed it.

715
00:39:53,452 --> 00:39:54,631
Maybe it got stolen.

716
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,335
Sorry. Nothing we can do.

717
00:39:56,513 --> 00:39:57,914
- Fuck you.
- Chandra!

718
00:39:57,974 --> 00:39:59,038
She ain't helping me.

719
00:39:59,104 --> 00:40:00,038
That's how they do.

720
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:01,663
Just tell her what you need.

721
00:40:01,703 --> 00:40:03,091
Need another card, bitch.

722
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:05,148
And that's reality.

723
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,937
Fuck you for real.

724
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:12,971
Calm down. Calm down.

725
00:40:13,338 --> 00:40:14,507
Go with Ms. Mason.

726
00:40:14,587 --> 00:40:15,560
Get your hands off!

727
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:18,729
I'll get the school police.

728
00:40:21,276 --> 00:40:22,453
She was like...

729
00:40:22,592 --> 00:40:24,270
and then--
and then she was like...

730
00:40:24,337 --> 00:40:25,404
typical day?

731
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:28,003
I wouldn't know.
My first time.

732
00:40:29,521 --> 00:40:30,574
Your first time?

733
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,149
Mrs. Donnelly oversees this project.

734
00:40:50,123 --> 00:40:51,355
Good morning, ladies.

735
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:53,382
Help a man get something to eat?

736
00:40:56,181 --> 00:40:57,234
God bless.

737
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,636
Good morning, reverend.

738
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:18,535
Glad you finally answered.

739
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:21,455
Yeah, I was in a meeting yesterday.
You got the asshole pinned down?

740
00:41:21,575 --> 00:41:24,014
Nah, I got Marlo's people
getting ready to make a drop.

741
00:41:24,173 --> 00:41:25,201
Where?

742
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,412
Edmondson and Pulaski.

743
00:41:26,591 --> 00:41:28,011
You eyeballing them right now?

744
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,390
Yeah, he got the package.

745
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,240
Black bag,
putting it in the trunk.

746
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,214
- He getting in it right now.
- What make?

747
00:41:33,652 --> 00:41:34,943
Late model Lincoln.

748
00:41:35,845 --> 00:41:37,580
- You want the license?
- Yeah, give it.

749
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:41,434
P-R-8-Z-G-O-D.

750
00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:45,301
Yeah, he pulling out now,
turning down Gilmore.

751
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,993
Dozerman, get me foxtrot.

752
00:41:47,092 --> 00:41:49,000
Good job, Bubs.
We're on it.

753
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:53,965
Ladies, a cellphone?
It's got, like, a half-hour on it.

754
00:41:53,975 --> 00:41:55,028
No thank you.

755
00:42:09,845 --> 00:42:10,997
What I saw today

756
00:42:11,386 --> 00:42:13,651
wasn't education
as I understand the term,

757
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:17,494
and they didn't seem
very socialized, either.

758
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:19,846
You didn't catch us on our best day.

759
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:21,255
Or your worst day?

760
00:42:21,295 --> 00:42:23,606
On the whole, they've actually
made a lot of progress.

761
00:42:23,665 --> 00:42:26,087
I mean, they come to class,
they're more engaged.

762
00:42:26,146 --> 00:42:27,279
We're reaching them.

763
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:29,214
Fewer outbursts,
no suspensions.

764
00:42:29,492 --> 00:42:31,653
But are they really learning anything?

765
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:33,568
Yes.
We believe they are.

766
00:42:33,707 --> 00:42:34,798
Be truthful.

767
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:38,292
If this program were to continue

768
00:42:38,351 --> 00:42:40,093
trough the rest of the school year,

769
00:42:40,232 --> 00:42:42,666
how many of your students
could realistically

770
00:42:43,174 --> 00:42:45,757
be expected to return
to a regular classroom?

771
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,725
What do you think, Ms. Duquette?

772
00:42:49,628 --> 00:42:52,747
Namond, Darnell,
maybe Zenobia.

773
00:42:53,999 --> 00:42:56,824
Look, considering where we started
and considering that those kids

774
00:42:56,844 --> 00:42:58,811
ain't out there
tearing up other classes--

775
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,102
Mrs. Donnelly.

776
00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:02,519
A tremendous achievement.

777
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,665
Mr. Withers?

778
00:43:08,056 --> 00:43:09,964
I'll go along with Mrs. Donnelly.

779
00:43:12,288 --> 00:43:13,957
You haven't said anything yet.

780
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:15,851
I just don't see it.

781
00:43:16,475 --> 00:43:18,796
Many of these kids
are profoundly damaged--

782
00:43:19,227 --> 00:43:21,770
what they've seen,
how they've lived.

783
00:43:22,524 --> 00:43:25,783
And I think any gain or progress
is temporary.

784
00:43:26,676 --> 00:43:28,643
I think this project
may be flawed.

785
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,211
<i>Foxtrot 23-30.</i>

786
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:34,933
<i>We have a visual on the suspect.</i>
<i>Vehicle headed east on Mulberry.</i>

787
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:36,130
<i>Do you copy?</i>

788
00:43:36,552 --> 00:43:37,862
10-4. We're almost there.

789
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,962
10-4...

790
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,410
After your phone call,

791
00:43:46,946 --> 00:43:48,901
I checked.
It came directly from Burrell.

792
00:43:49,306 --> 00:43:52,318
He bypassed Rawls
after I specifically told him he was--

793
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,437
Burrell's making a play
for you to keep him.

794
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:58,682
By, uh, just--
what did you call that?

795
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:00,351
Juking the stats.

796
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:01,901
Guy is unbelievable.

797
00:44:01,962 --> 00:44:05,290
It runs completely counter to
all my discussions with Rawls,

798
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:06,741
with you, with everyone.

799
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,094
He's also serving notice.

800
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,586
He's reasserting control
of the department.

801
00:44:10,937 --> 00:44:13,838
He probably figures if you can't
fire him, then you can't fire him.

802
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:15,618
And does Rawls know?

803
00:44:15,746 --> 00:44:17,630
My guess is,
Rawls heard about it days ago

804
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,628
from half a dozen
district commanders.

805
00:44:19,972 --> 00:44:21,561
Why wouldn't he come to me?

806
00:44:21,913 --> 00:44:23,006
Talk to him.

807
00:44:24,407 --> 00:44:25,790
Why did you come to me?

808
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:27,590
I mean, why not go to Rawls?

809
00:44:30,832 --> 00:44:32,993
Because I need to know
if you're serious.

810
00:44:33,413 --> 00:44:36,215
If Rawls already came to you
and this shit is still going on,

811
00:44:36,334 --> 00:44:38,993
then you're OK with it,
which is for me a problem.

812
00:44:39,412 --> 00:44:40,529
If he didn't come to you,

813
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:42,765
then either he's OK with it,
which is also a problem,

814
00:44:42,784 --> 00:44:44,999
or he's letting it go,
trying give Burrell enough rope

815
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:48,100
for you to get angry and fire
the man for insubordination.

816
00:44:48,765 --> 00:44:50,694
But I need to know
where you stand.

817
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:52,643
Well, I gave you my word.

818
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:56,036
Yes.
You did.

819
00:44:58,275 --> 00:45:00,818
Well, thanks for going outside
the chain of command.

820
00:45:03,655 --> 00:45:05,721
Don't expect me
to make a habit of it.

821
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,698
Stay in the car!

822
00:45:21,169 --> 00:45:23,851
Stay in the car.
Keep your hands on the wheel.

823
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:28,933
- Let's see those hands.
- What's the problem, officer?

824
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:31,158
Step slowly out of the vehicle.
Keep your hands up.

825
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:45,869
Son, be gentler than that.

826
00:45:46,227 --> 00:45:47,524
Fuck up.
I ain't your son.

827
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,424
This guy.

828
00:46:08,421 --> 00:46:10,308
What's this, huh?
What's this?

829
00:46:23,677 --> 00:46:24,850
Do you know what?

830
00:46:25,356 --> 00:46:28,395
I'm gonna damn sure
get your name and badge number.

831
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:39,190
Daniels.
I don't think I know him.

832
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:41,126
Oh, he hasn't
played much politics,

833
00:46:41,225 --> 00:46:44,475
though he used to be married
to the new councilwoman in the 11th.

834
00:46:44,654 --> 00:46:45,871
Marla Daniels?

835
00:46:46,552 --> 00:46:47,664
That's the one.

836
00:46:47,899 --> 00:46:51,564
This is the last man we want
as police commissioner, Nerese.

837
00:46:51,663 --> 00:46:54,795
I mean, I squared off against
this fellow a few years back,

838
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,361
and he wouldn't listen to me.

839
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,081
He's not gonna listen to you
or the ministers

840
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,655
or anyone else in the community.

841
00:47:00,754 --> 00:47:01,901
Just Carcetti?

842
00:47:02,328 --> 00:47:04,473
Oh, he's the mayor's boy,
definitely.

843
00:47:04,873 --> 00:47:07,310
Carcetti is looking
for how much of a salary bump?

844
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:08,641
50,000, at least,

845
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,973
To make the position
competitive nationally.

846
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:12,682
Give him 25.

847
00:47:12,854 --> 00:47:15,755
It'll be enough to make him think
he'll win you over eventually

848
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:18,321
but less than he needs
to entice anyone real.

849
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,105
Meanwhile, Carcetti's gonna
have to give Daniels

850
00:47:21,184 --> 00:47:24,363
6 months in C.I.D.
before he can bump him again,

851
00:47:24,543 --> 00:47:25,687
for appearance's sake.

852
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,220
So we're buying time here.

853
00:47:27,551 --> 00:47:30,438
Enough for Ervin to show
the new mayor who butters the bread.

854
00:47:30,577 --> 00:47:34,387
And for events to take the new
penny shine off Cedric Daniels.

855
00:47:34,821 --> 00:47:38,487
I happen to know he's less
the saint than he pretends to be.

856
00:47:47,712 --> 00:47:51,070
This is senator Davis.
Is the mayor in at the moment?

857
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:56,745
Well...
you just tell him his friend Clay

858
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:01,829
got the council president to un-ass a
salary bump for the police commissioner.

859
00:48:02,587 --> 00:48:03,918
You tell him...

860
00:48:04,942 --> 00:48:06,174
write this down, now.

861
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:11,688
You tell him that senator Davis
has his interests at heart.

862
00:48:14,215 --> 00:48:15,327
Right.

863
00:48:16,676 --> 00:48:17,809
Thanks.

864
00:48:32,939 --> 00:48:34,929
Hey, ma.
How was New York?

865
00:48:37,124 --> 00:48:39,111
Hey, Ms. Brice.
How are you?

866
00:48:39,858 --> 00:48:40,990
Who asking?

867
00:48:42,057 --> 00:48:44,541
This is my teacher, mom--
Mr. Colvin.

868
00:48:45,064 --> 00:48:47,329
Why he here?
You in trouble?

869
00:48:47,827 --> 00:48:49,417
He stayed at our house last night,

870
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:51,500
with you being in New York and all.

871
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:55,161
Tell her.

872
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,804
The cops picked me up,
saying I was slinging.

873
00:49:00,133 --> 00:49:02,438
They was gonna send me
to baby booking.

874
00:49:02,995 --> 00:49:04,227
But we took him in.

875
00:49:07,999 --> 00:49:11,316
You leave my son
the fuck alone.

876
00:49:11,802 --> 00:49:14,932
And you,
you afraid to go to baby booking?

877
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:18,831
The fuck is wrong with you, boy?
Get in the damn house!

878
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:35,548
Kid got the point.

879
00:49:35,952 --> 00:49:38,695
Only drunk and disorderlies
and squeegee boys,

880
00:49:38,774 --> 00:49:40,521
graffiti artists,
and public urinators,

881
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:43,335
and here we come in with
a pair of felony burglaries.

882
00:49:43,553 --> 00:49:45,345
Nice of you to give him the collar.

883
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,446
Well, he might turn out a decent police.

884
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:49,062
Got to come from somewhere.

885
00:49:49,122 --> 00:49:50,274
Young generation.

886
00:49:51,313 --> 00:49:52,444
What about you guys?

887
00:49:52,502 --> 00:49:54,191
You gonna follow
in your dad's footsteps?

888
00:49:54,231 --> 00:49:55,499
Hello. I don't think so.

889
00:49:56,247 --> 00:49:57,281
Nah.

890
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:59,446
- What, then?
- Video game designer.

891
00:50:00,035 --> 00:50:01,097
Rock star.

892
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,853
They want to make money.

893
00:50:03,992 --> 00:50:05,140
You schooled them well.

894
00:50:05,259 --> 00:50:06,851
How about you, little Bunk?

895
00:50:07,363 --> 00:50:09,039
You'll be a detective
like your daddy?

896
00:50:09,138 --> 00:50:10,608
- Chief of police.
- Nah.

897
00:50:10,887 --> 00:50:12,108
Why not?

898
00:50:12,287 --> 00:50:13,519
How about you?

899
00:50:14,836 --> 00:50:18,532
Oh, he's still in that, you know,
pediatric neurosurgeon stage.

900
00:50:23,925 --> 00:50:25,414
Elena, how are you doing?

901
00:50:25,553 --> 00:50:26,979
I'm good.
How are you?

902
00:50:27,448 --> 00:50:28,660
Can't complain.

903
00:50:29,664 --> 00:50:31,094
Hey, boys. How are you?

904
00:50:31,732 --> 00:50:32,885
Can you say hi?

905
00:50:33,372 --> 00:50:36,480
Listen. They're fine.
They really do have manners.

906
00:50:36,724 --> 00:50:38,589
It's all right.
My kids are the same way.

907
00:50:38,788 --> 00:50:41,008
We're just finishing up.
You can sit down.

908
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:44,199
OK. Just for a minute.

909
00:50:45,178 --> 00:50:46,772
Dad, 5 bucks for the jukebox?

910
00:50:46,931 --> 00:50:49,735
What? What happened to
3 plays for a quarter?

911
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,035
Homework?

912
00:50:54,871 --> 00:50:56,212
Done. Dad helped us.

913
00:50:57,736 --> 00:50:59,312
I got off early.
Here.

914
00:51:01,021 --> 00:51:02,273
You want to go, too?

915
00:51:04,607 --> 00:51:05,804
So what are you drinking?

916
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:07,291
I'll have a white wine.

917
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,478
I'm good, thanks.

918
00:51:22,758 --> 00:51:25,619
So it's true?
You quit drinking?

919
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,369
Well, I have a beer
now and again.

920
00:51:29,426 --> 00:51:30,658
No big deal.

921
00:51:35,685 --> 00:51:36,976
How's Dennis?

922
00:51:39,282 --> 00:51:42,421
Dennis is...
Dennis.

923
00:51:43,045 --> 00:51:44,515
We're close, we're not.

924
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:46,947
You know.
We'll see.

925
00:51:48,334 --> 00:51:49,565
How's Beadie?

926
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:51,543
We're good.

927
00:51:52,374 --> 00:51:54,016
The kids have my number, but...

928
00:52:01,637 --> 00:52:04,359
If I had known you were gonna
grow up to be a grownup...

929
00:52:08,773 --> 00:52:09,942
Man.

930
00:52:10,325 --> 00:52:14,376
And I'm the one that told him to do
the right thing and go talk to the man.

931
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:16,736
It don't seem that way now, do it?

932
00:52:17,585 --> 00:52:20,526
I mean, yo, you got to look at
it from Marlo's point of view.

933
00:52:20,709 --> 00:52:22,343
I mean, how this different from Wallace?

934
00:52:22,383 --> 00:52:24,341
Because Stringer said
Wallace snitched.

935
00:52:24,714 --> 00:52:26,863
Yo. Kevin might have snitched, too.

936
00:52:27,002 --> 00:52:28,241
Man, but he didn't.

937
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:30,408
And we had to do Wallace!

938
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,675
Yo, Marlo thought he had to do Kevin.

939
00:52:33,141 --> 00:52:34,452
Man. But he didn't.

940
00:52:35,671 --> 00:52:36,903
That's what I'm saying.

941
00:52:39,081 --> 00:52:40,441
He's a cold motherfucker.

942
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:42,450
It's a cold world, Bodie.

943
00:52:43,642 --> 00:52:45,510
Thought you said
it was getting warmer, man.

944
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:49,363
World going one way;
people another, yo.

945
00:52:52,889 --> 00:52:55,073
Now, Elton Brand--
what you know about him?

946
00:52:55,436 --> 00:52:57,442
Nothing. You see?

947
00:52:57,775 --> 00:52:59,265
Bug, you seen your daddy?

948
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:01,435
Went to the store.

949
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,725
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna look for him.

950
00:53:09,133 --> 00:53:10,507
You ain't gonna find him.

951
00:53:10,766 --> 00:53:11,895
Why not?

952
00:53:13,979 --> 00:53:15,509
Because he ain't coming back.

953
00:53:36,825 --> 00:53:37,858
Thanks.

954
00:54:19,198 --> 00:54:20,430
What's this about?

955
00:54:21,465 --> 00:54:22,516
Like you don't know.

956
00:54:22,536 --> 00:54:25,538
Man, I ain't been home long enough
to get in somebody's shit.

957
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:29,214
You like boys, motherfucker?

958
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:31,237
What?

959
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:32,981
Boys. You like fucking them?

960
00:54:34,326 --> 00:54:36,603

Living with a woman now.
