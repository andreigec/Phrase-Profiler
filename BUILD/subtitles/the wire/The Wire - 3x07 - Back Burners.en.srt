1
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:37,154
All quiet today?

2
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:38,927
Keepin' it like that, boss.

3
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:42,166
We rule where we stand.

4
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:51,353
Police sittin' on all
the corners over these parts.

5
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,596
Likely because
we been droppin' bodies.

6
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,293
Yeah, they do like that.

7
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:58,283
But you know tomorrow
some other nigger stop a bullet

8
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,736
somewhere else and then they
go stand on a new spot.

9
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:02,672
Boy Marlo closed up shop.

10
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:06,782
Word is he wholesaling
his packages for now.

11
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:09,726
He ain't got no crews
out here at all?

12
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,814
How 'bout his avenue corners?

13
00:02:13,222 --> 00:02:14,923
Nigger give up quick, didn't he?

14
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:19,827
Damn, I was just beginnin' to respect
the little motherfucker for showin' heart.

15
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,281
A- ight, listen.

16
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:24,484
When the police roll out,
y'all step in there an' take my corners.

17
00:02:24,507 --> 00:02:25,469
I'm on it, B.

18
00:02:26,797 --> 00:02:28,052
Cheesesteaks from Bill's.

19
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,198
Nah, I did that tuesday, man.

20
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:31,970
Fuck it then, you pick.

21
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:44,034
Naw, fuck me.

22
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:45,371
What?

23
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:47,037
Mope in the truck.

24
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:48,608
What about him?

25
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:49,922
I think I locked him up.

26
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:52,397
Avon whatshisface.

27
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,356
Big player from the projects.

28
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,824
He was the target on that detail
I worked a couple years back

29
00:02:57,906 --> 00:02:59,290
the one I told you about.

30
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,472
Motherfucker's out already.

31
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:07,452
Why, what'd he pull?

32
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:09,962
Six, eight years.
Who the fuck can remember?

33
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:11,956
An' he's out in two?

34
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:15,182
Maybe I got the years wrong.

35
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,943
Point is guy's an asshole.
Locked him up is all.

36
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:22,755
Pit beef, from the market.

37
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:24,773
See? Now you thinkin' like police.

38
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,440
Back Burners

39
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,365
Change in plan.

40
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:06,883
Bell you recognize.

41
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:11,188
Second target is a Marlo Stanfield

42
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:14,167
who is apparently warring
with Bell for Westside corners.

43
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:15,906
What about Kintel Williamson?

44
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:17,806
That case is on hold for now.

45
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:18,932
On hold?

46
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:22,498
We just managed to I.D. the cell
phones on two of his people.

47
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:23,609
Be that as it may...

48
00:05:23,632 --> 00:05:24,993
why not take
a few more weeks

49
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:27,527
and we can put together what
we got on Kintel, you know?

50
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,811
We send the case to grand jury
and then we start up this Westside case.

51
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:32,771
Otherwise, we wasted
more than two months...

52
00:05:32,806 --> 00:05:35,844
change of target comes to us from
the Commissioner and the Deputy Ops.

53
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:37,416
The department is
in a reactive mode

54
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,926
trying to get the murder rate down
by any means necessary.

55
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,389
Kintel was dropping bodies
two months ago.

56
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:45,697
Today, it's the Westside
that's got the bosses spinning.

57
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:49,001
Look, I know y'all thought
it was nothin' for me to sit on that roof

58
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:52,509
day after 90-degree day,
dodgin' swarms of cicadas

59
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:54,385
and shit, but damn.
This is fucked up.

60
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,197
And all the assets
work I did on Kintel.

61
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:59,097
His cars, his cash flow...

62
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:01,700
I just put that in a drawer?

63
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:13,134
Some day I wanna work
for a real police department.

64
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,008
Just to see how the fuck
they do it, you know?

65
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:20,970
McNulty.

66
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,284
In my office.

67
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:33,676
Hey, Prez, can you
run something out for me?

68
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,368
What?

69
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:36,725
I need to know
who reed this room

70
00:06:36,726 --> 00:06:38,885
in the downtown Hilton,
thursday before last.

71
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:40,087
Who rented the room?

72
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:43,359
Address, credit card details,
whatever you can pull.

73
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:45,623
How's it fit with the case?

74
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:48,462
Hard to say just yet.

75
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:52,555
Hey, my man.

76
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:53,682
I'm done mowin'.

77
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,653
So I figured I'd use this
to edge the weeds around the fence.

78
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:02,550
- It's gas-powered.
- Means I got to prime it.

79
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:04,978
You ain't got school me but once.

80
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,894
Get some water
before you go back out there.

81
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,188
You been goin' hard at it.

82
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:15,132
You keep showin' up at the spot,
I'll keep puttin' you on.

83
00:07:15,155 --> 00:07:17,454
Good, 'cause I ain't
got nothin' else.

84
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:21,463
You walked back through
them old doors, didn't you?

85
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:23,950
Tried to.

86
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:26,824
I took you for gone.

87
00:07:27,524 --> 00:07:31,934
Man, parole officers,
employment agencies...

88
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:35,934
shit, I just felt like I was
an interruption to their lunch break.

89
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,248
No family?

90
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:40,825
None besides my grandmother.

91
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:42,960
She put me up in the basement.

92
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:45,858
That's plenty to ask
of the old girl right there.

93
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,351
You could use someone to talk
to 'sides your grandmoms.

94
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,732
What about one of them
social worker types?

95
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:52,964
I hooked up with one dude.

96
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:57,093
He was cool, but I wasn't ready.

97
00:07:58,243 --> 00:07:59,568
You look like you ready now.

98
00:08:00,242 --> 00:08:03,257
I mean, you found an ear to bend,
you wouldn't have to talk to me.

99
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,389
Shit, I know you gonna get tired
of lookin' at my ugly-ass grill.

100
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,491
Drink that too fast,
you'll cramp up.

101
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:17,820
- You're asking?
- I am.

102
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,077
Lieutenant, I didn't...

103
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:21,894
Because I got no problem
changing targets

104
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,743
if that's what the bosses
tell me to do.

105
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:25,854
Unless it's personal.

106
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:27,672
Like when Kima got shot...

107
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:30,482
I don't care where
we spend our time and money.

108
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,106
Bell, Williamson, whoever.
It's all just police work to me.

109
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:37,051
And I understand that people
above my pay-grade have the right

110
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:38,810
to make decisions
that are theirs to make.

111
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:39,749
And if they're wrong?

112
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,983
Then they're wrong
and time will tell, won't it?

113
00:08:43,294 --> 00:08:45,229
Now, I'm asking you for the truth.

114
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,537
You went to Colvin. Behind my back.

115
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:50,308
I'da gone to the devil himself.

116
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:52,502
Which way you were standing,
Lieutenant

117
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:54,191
had not a fucking
thing to do with it.

118
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:55,571
You piece of shit.

119
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:58,926
I did it because it had to be done

120
00:08:59,407 --> 00:09:01,325
just like it had to be
done two years ago

121
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:02,685
when we were first detailed.

122
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:05,966
Stringer was the target then,
he's still the target now.

123
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,134
Lieutenant, you know,
as bosses go

124
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:14,593
you're better than most

125
00:09:15,497 --> 00:09:18,464
and I know you went out of your
way to get me off that boat.

126
00:09:19,356 --> 00:09:19,988
I know that.

127
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,969
But now we're back
on the right man.

128
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:40,335
Detective McNulty.

129
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:45,895
When the cuffs go on Stringer,
you need to find a new home.

130
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,546
You're done in this unit.

131
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:02,586
Count right?

132
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:04,979
Yeah, went almost to Richmond
for this here batch.

133
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:06,386
Yeah, I'm holdin'...

134
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:09,282
- You did like we say, right?
- Yeah.

135
00:10:09,763 --> 00:10:10,396
Give him that.

136
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:14,748
We're gonna need another
60 more in a couple days.

137
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:15,569
60 more?!

138
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:17,939
You know how we do.
So don't be cryin', Bernard.

139
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:29,031
You musta left something out.

140
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,174
Fuck no. I got the part ones
from every sector, every post.

141
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:33,523
We're down about two percent.

142
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:35,479
Now where exactly are we down?

143
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:37,367
Larcenies and burglaries are steady

144
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:39,913
but shootings and agg
assaults are both down.

145
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:42,951
Drug arrests, too, but I guess
that won't look so good.

146
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,704
I mean, where geographically
are we down?

147
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:46,983
In the district?

148
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:49,599
Well, the posts near the
designated drug zones are up

149
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:51,264
almost all of them.

150
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,781
That ain't pretty.
But everywhere else is down.

151
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,938
In some places
as much as four percent.

152
00:10:59,648 --> 00:11:00,867
Bosses are gonna love you.

153
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:02,840
It's too soon to take any credit.

154
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:06,019
This might be, whatcha call that

155
00:11:06,136 --> 00:11:07,368
statistical aberration.

156
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:09,545
You ain't gonna let them know

157
00:11:09,557 --> 00:11:11,516
that your little experiment
might be working?

158
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:12,454
Not yet, no.

159
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,583
But I'll tell you
what we are gonna do:

160
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:16,686
Starting next week

161
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:18,785
I want you to pull one car
out of service on

162
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:21,507
the quiet posts in every sector,
all three shifts.

163
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:23,724
We'll take those nine guys

164
00:11:23,818 --> 00:11:26,312
gonna use 'em and double up
on the high-crime posts.

165
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:29,691
If we handle less of it

166
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:32,811
we ought to do better with
the crime we've got, right?

167
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:39,320
Can I get two
Trac disposable phones.

168
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,182
They on special. Four for 180?

169
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:43,108
Just the two.

170
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:55,854
Last show out at Westview is 8:45.

171
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:58,646
We could make that if we don't
make the whole damn run today.

172
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:01,797
Seem to me one phone
is as good as the next.

173
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:04,976
Only a fool drive all over the
world when there ain't no need.

174
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:07,791
Keep on with that shit an' I'ma
leave your ass in Baltimore.

175
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,043
I don't trust no man
on the road by hisself, okay?

176
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:11,111
I'm not stupid.

177
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,181
Stupid ass fucker.

178
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,566
Commissioner!

179
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:22,755
How goes it?

180
00:12:24,174 --> 00:12:26,450
It went a lot better before
the Mayor's cabinet meeting

181
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:27,435
I can tell you that.

182
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:28,327
He rip you?

183
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,878
Says we need to finish under 300
for this year regardless of how it happens.

184
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:35,597
- I tried to tell...
- Erv, lemme ask you...

185
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,936
where do you guys stand on this
witness assistance thing?

186
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:42,663
What?

187
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:45,898
Overhauling the city's
witness assistance program?

188
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:50,238
Nobody from the Mayor's office
called you regarding

189
00:12:50,262 --> 00:12:52,092
this problem of witnesses
getting killed?

190
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,786
I got a call from the chief
of staff a week ago, yeah.

191
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:58,152
But all he said was
I should try not to have

192
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,560
any more witnesses get killed.

193
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:01,648
But overhauling the program?

194
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,171
Unless someone wants
to spend a lot more money

195
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:06,373
there's not a whole
helluva lot my people can do.

196
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:08,790
And you haven't talked
to the Mayor directly on this?

197
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,477
You're not gonna fuck me on this?

198
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:15,128
As it is, I got
the Mayor's teeth in my ass.

199
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,794
Your name does not get mentioned.

200
00:13:19,891 --> 00:13:21,275
Mayor didn't say a word to me.

201
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:24,044
Thanks.

202
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:43,851
Where the fuck we at now!?

203
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:47,346
Just buy four or five, Bernard.

204
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:49,411
Do it like that
and it'll go twice as quick.

205
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,966
I want a Shrek Slurpee, Bernard.
And some Krispee Kreme.

206
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:59,809
All this from one disposable
cell phone?

207
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,346
And a dead one, too.

208
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:06,257
It was used by Marlo's people
and picked up off the ground by Kima's C.I.

209
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,392
Problem is it's just raw data.

210
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,172
We need to firm up what we know
about Marlo's operation

211
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:12,908
with surveillance and C.I. info.

212
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,504
On the other hand

213
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,155
if we had a burner
that we knew was used

214
00:14:17,178 --> 00:14:18,774
by one of Stringer's players...

215
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:21,788
we could use what we know
about that origination to make

216
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,903
all kinds of connections.

217
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:26,242
Get us one good phone,
we'll give you the network.

218
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,365
That's the good news.

219
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:29,457
What's the bad?

220
00:14:30,066 --> 00:14:31,544
It's all historical.

221
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,149
We can give you
the network no problem

222
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,892
but by then it's a week old
and they've dumped their phones.

223
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:40,367
And how we get a wire up on that...

224
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:42,607
I haven't figured out yet.

225
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:45,270
Well, see that you do, detective.

226
00:14:56,273 --> 00:14:59,452
Oh, yeah. You keep this job.
I'ma gain some serious weight.

227
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:01,411
- Just the two?
- Just the two.

228
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:03,933
Nigga, you ain't never
hearda buyin' in bulk?

229
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:06,021
You could be savin'
them people all kinda money.

230
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:07,569
Or better still, spendin' it on me.

231
00:15:24,394 --> 00:15:26,130
Why you got a gun, Bernard?

232
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:28,886
You ain't heard?
Avon's home, so we toolin' up.

233
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:31,397
You ain't the only one on parole.

234
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:33,543
Girl, you ridin'
my last good nerve.

235
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,731
That's not the only thing
I can ride.

236
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:37,397
Just get me back to the Interstate?

237
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,869
<i>Big white bag,
got the big white bag!</i>

238
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:43,754
Which one is he, again?

239
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:46,275
Broadus, street name of Bodie.

240
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,257
He used to bein the low-rises.

241
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:50,052
Had a tower later on.

242
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:57,246
<i>Big white,
got the big white!</i>

243
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,276
How many more minutes you think
he's got on that phone?

244
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,530
Fuck this, let's hit the bar.

245
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:10,582
Lester needs a phone, man.

246
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,987
There's an easier way.
I'll show you tomorrow.

247
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:15,486
C'mon.

248
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,726
<i>Got the big white. </i>

249
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:18,286
I'm buying.

250
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:31,733
<i>Big white bag,
got the big white bag!</i>

251
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,285
She just wants
me to be happy, you know?

252
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:41,015
An' I mean, I do the same for her,
when I can.

253
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:44,898
Like this thing
with the police detective?

254
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:48,425
Brianna says she wants me
to go downtown with her, and...

255
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:51,181
I dunno,
hear the man out about Dee...

256
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:55,908
and I know there ain't nothing to it,
but she's all upset you know.

257
00:16:56,638 --> 00:16:58,433
And I tried to tell her
what you told me

258
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:03,454
but she says she wants to go down there
and talk to him herself I guess.

259
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:04,709
You told her about the cop?

260
00:17:05,882 --> 00:17:06,339
What?

261
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:07,606
About the detective.

262
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:09,331
What you told me, you told her?

263
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:10,539
It's her son, right?

264
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:13,859
I mean, she got a right
to know what's goin' on.

265
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:18,160
- Look, I just thought...
- What?!

266
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:23,580
Why the fuck you gonna get her
all upset over some bullshit?

267
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,658
Here we are, fuckin' year later,
everybody forgot about the shit

268
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,652
you go runnin' your
mouth about nothin' at all.

269
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:29,563
But, String...

270
00:17:29,564 --> 00:17:31,417
What, an' she gonna
believe that shit, too.

271
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,915
What mom is not gonna believe
her son didn't kill hisself?

272
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:34,795
String...

273
00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:37,669
How she gonna take to that shit,
go half-crazy with it.

274
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:40,371
- I just...
- You just what?

275
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:42,292
Sorry.

276
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:02,239
When you tell her that?

277
00:18:02,696 --> 00:18:04,057
'Bout a week ago, I guess.

278
00:18:04,444 --> 00:18:05,980
When she gonna go see the cop?

279
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,416
Think she gonna
talk to a lawyer first.

280
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:11,130
- Ask him how to play it.
- Who Levy?

281
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:12,792
I guess, whoever.

282
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,141
- The lawyer.
- Levy?

283
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,980
- I guess.
- Oh, you didn't ask that?

284
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:32,804
And this fucking Royce
just lets it slide.

285
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:34,535
I mean, I go to him, right?

286
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,681
Not to make points,
just to do the right thing

287
00:18:36,705 --> 00:18:38,523
what does he do
but blow smoke up my ass.

288
00:18:39,637 --> 00:18:41,572
"I'm glad you came
to us with this, Tommy... "

289
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:44,340
"Oh, I'll light a fire, don't you worry.
We gotta move on this. "

290
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:49,255
I never thought he'd have the balls
to just fuck the dog on it.

291
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:51,398
And you were doing the right thing.

292
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,090
Fuck yeah.

293
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:54,201
What?

294
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,451
You went there hoping
that Royce would disappoint.

295
00:18:57,756 --> 00:19:00,574
You want to know that you're better,
that you deserve his chair.

296
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:03,342
If I lie down on this couch,
do you charge by the hour?

297
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:04,985
Thanks.

298
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:07,847
You're not naive.

299
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:09,243
Neither am I.

300
00:19:09,794 --> 00:19:13,075
A man doesn't run for office
without being a bit self-righteous first.

301
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,365
Self-righteous?

302
00:19:15,468 --> 00:19:15,996
Me?

303
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:18,119
So what are you gonna do now?

304
00:19:19,069 --> 00:19:20,718
Call a reporter or two,
rip the Mayor.

305
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,970
Maybe on background,
maybe go on the record. I dunno.

306
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:23,733
Rip him now?

307
00:19:24,425 --> 00:19:25,915
With the primary next september?

308
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:29,483
Tommy, no one's gonna remember
a dead witness a year from now?

309
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:31,348
Better if you go to Royce

310
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:33,846
confront him, not angrily

311
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:36,881
give him a chance to explain.
Or maybe take action.

312
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,966
If he does do something,
then a problem got fixed

313
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,726
and you can feel
special for helping.

314
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:44,060
If he doesn't, you sit tight.

315
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:45,609
I don't know.

316
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:47,896
Maybe you document
your meeting in a letter

317
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:49,832
expressing your concern and regret.

318
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:52,600
Then you're set
if the next witness gets killed.

319
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:55,896
Win-win.

320
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,790
Unless you're the witness.

321
00:19:58,142 --> 00:19:59,444
I know, you're right.

322
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,330
But he's taking
on a two-term incumbent.

323
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:04,805
It's all gonna be ugly from here.

324
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,766
Yeah, it's cool.

325
00:20:20,628 --> 00:20:22,200
Need another 30 by monday, a-ight.

326
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:22,962
A- ight.

327
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:32,306
Bitch, everything I say
you hear backwards.

328
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:34,254
Stupid little fucker.

329
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,087
Got them tees, bright white!

330
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,066
One for three, two for five.

331
00:20:43,852 --> 00:20:45,448
<i>Blue Tops, got them Blue Tops!</i>

332
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,189
I got them tees.

333
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,105
Bright white,
one for three, two for five.

334
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,371
I got this, man, five dollar.

335
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:07,060
- New.
- No thank you, man.

336
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,808
- It's only five dollars.
- No thank you.

337
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:10,544
Fuck you, man, fuck you.

338
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:11,318
Fuck you.

339
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:25,592
I got them, uh...

340
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:29,428
I got them tees.

341
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:39,914
<i>Red Tops, Red Tops,
got them Red Tops!</i>

342
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,392
<i>Rockefeller,
got them Rockefeller here!</i>

343
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,711
Hey, seller man, what you got?

344
00:21:57,562 --> 00:21:59,521
Got the long white tees
for the young ones.

345
00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:01,891
You ain't got candles?
I'm lookin' to buy candles.

346
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:04,049
And toilet paper
for the shitbucket, too.

347
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,313
You be back here tomorrow?

348
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,565
I can't leave.
I leave, somebody grab my stake.

349
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:11,506
I'll be back tomorrow.

350
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:39,335
Yo, Johnny.

351
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:49,121
Was' up, Bubs.

352
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:55,573
Shit, Johnny, man.

353
00:22:56,989 --> 00:22:58,936
Just been chasin'
that pipe, you know.

354
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,701
Shit got me all diggin'
and scratchin' in my arms.

355
00:23:04,074 --> 00:23:05,094
You know, it's cool.

356
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:09,100
Alright, come on, man,
you need a break. Alright?

357
00:23:09,206 --> 00:23:11,047
I'm serious, you need a break.
Come on, man.

358
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:12,373
Naw, man, look around you.

359
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:16,537
Soldier's paradise, man.

360
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:28,656
I'm a viking, Bubs.

361
00:23:34,155 --> 00:23:34,952
You a viking?

362
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:52,798
Fuck, not again.

363
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,055
You two coming?

364
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:57,697
Major said to get 'em down here

365
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:59,703
he didn't say shit
'bout playin' nursemaid

366
00:23:59,715 --> 00:24:01,029
to a bunch of goddamn animals.

367
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,807
Watch your back, watch your back.
Watch your back.

368
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:15,296
Should we cuff 'em, sarge?

369
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:16,579
Naw, cut 'em loose.

370
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:20,389
The fuck we tell you about
fighting down here?

371
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:23,596
Only rule is no fighting,
no cutting, no shooting!

372
00:24:23,768 --> 00:24:25,004
An' y'all still fuck it up.

373
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:29,035
Next time you make me come down here,
see if I don't call for a ten-thirty-eight.

374
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:32,211
So you know, dickhead,
that's an ambulance.

375
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,482
Break it up,
break it up, break it up.

376
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:18,311
Did I wake the baby?

377
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:19,891
You would know if you did.

378
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:24,303
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Nice of you to check in.

379
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,916
I went out after work to unwind.

380
00:25:26,979 --> 00:25:28,251
Yeah, you look unwound.

381
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:32,225
Well...

382
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:36,152
I figured you had everything
under control on the homefront.

383
00:25:36,746 --> 00:25:38,284
What the fuck is wrong with you?

384
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:40,740
What's with the sarcasm?

385
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:43,009
How come you can talk
to everybody else but me?

386
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:45,011
You really want to know?

387
00:25:46,748 --> 00:25:47,480
I'm listening.

388
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,250
I miss us.

389
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:54,723
Do not blame that baby.

390
00:25:55,474 --> 00:25:57,039
Do not do it.

391
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:58,353
I'm not blamin' anybody.

392
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,403
I didn't do this by myself.

393
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,202
We discussed it, all of it.

394
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,095
We talked about it, yeah.

395
00:26:04,783 --> 00:26:05,331
But...

396
00:26:10,294 --> 00:26:12,453
I didn't have as much
to say about it as you.

397
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:14,268
And why not?

398
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:15,926
Because you...

399
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,150
you wanted this.

400
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,093
I didn't want
to disappoint you on it.

401
00:26:31,913 --> 00:26:34,863
I don't think I could be more
disappointed than I am right now.

402
00:26:42,113 --> 00:26:42,864
You need to go.

403
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:16,599
Quiet overnight?

404
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:19,572
Midnight shift had to toss a crew
that was casing the place.

405
00:27:20,526 --> 00:27:21,543
But other than that...

406
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,766
Too many damn children.

407
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:30,515
Whaddaya need lookouts and runners for
if the shit is legal?

408
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,800
A lot of them have been cut
loose by the dealers.

409
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:35,006
It's like one of those nature shows

410
00:27:35,335 --> 00:27:36,936
where you mess
with the environment

411
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:39,032
some species gets
fucked out of their habitat.

412
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:41,222
Did you just use the word
habitat in a sentence?

413
00:27:41,254 --> 00:27:41,723
I did.

414
00:27:51,674 --> 00:27:53,316
You let your lookouts go?

415
00:27:53,754 --> 00:27:54,537
My runners, too.

416
00:27:54,552 --> 00:27:56,007
Shit, what's the point?

417
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:58,624
So here you are
making money hand over fist

418
00:27:58,655 --> 00:28:01,173
and you're too damn greedy
to take care of your work force.

419
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:01,910
I don't need 'em.

420
00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:03,912
But they need you, right?

421
00:28:04,491 --> 00:28:06,744
You was all they had
when you couldn't work a corner

422
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:07,970
except for touts and runners

423
00:28:07,971 --> 00:28:10,271
then it was cool to have them
cut school and work out.

424
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:16,639
Okay, new tax initiative,
my brother.

425
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:17,828
Say what?

426
00:28:17,884 --> 00:28:19,871
If you wanna sling
in Hamsterdam after today

427
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:23,094
you an' every other knucklehead
you each gotta kick in a hunnert a week.

428
00:28:23,141 --> 00:28:24,815
Oh, so you tryin' to get paid, huh.

429
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:27,131
Not me, not for me.

430
00:28:29,762 --> 00:28:31,092
Get the cash up, I'll be back.

431
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,320
But it ain't something I'm gonna
go to jail for, right?

432
00:28:55,352 --> 00:28:57,338
I mean, it ain't nothing
like that is it?

433
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:07,276
That one?

434
00:29:07,978 --> 00:29:09,610
No, it was more black than silver.

435
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:11,503
This one, I think.

436
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:20,977
I can see y'all got some real
ugly shit planned for me.

437
00:29:21,322 --> 00:29:22,198
I can see it.

438
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:28,659
You just bumped up against
a clever police is all.

439
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:31,677
Course he's gonna try
to shame you with the dead girl

440
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:35,495
or some mess about children lookin' up
to Omar an' his sawed-off.

441
00:29:36,152 --> 00:29:37,486
All he can do

442
00:29:37,487 --> 00:29:40,828
especially since you backed down
what he had for a witness.

443
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:44,120
He workin' you with guilt, boy.

444
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:48,208
Yeah, but that fat man gave me
an itch I can't scratch, Butchie.

445
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,509
Everybody in this world does
what they gonna do.

446
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:54,138
Me, you, that police.

447
00:29:54,951 --> 00:29:57,289
Everybody in this world
got their own place.

448
00:29:58,572 --> 00:30:00,766
An' a man in your line of work

449
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:03,218
start worryin' about how other
people see you

450
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,526
playin' the other people,
instead of to hisself, he gonna get dead.

451
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,972
I still feel like
I owe somethin', Butch.

452
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:25,028
I had an uncle down Carolina,
he dead now

453
00:30:26,154 --> 00:30:28,911
but I remember he was
grieving real hard

454
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:32,191
real hard over chasin'
his lady friend away.

455
00:30:33,074 --> 00:30:34,654
So he put himself to punishment.

456
00:30:35,452 --> 00:30:38,956
Took a knife to his little finger
then his ring finger.

457
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,899
With them all bloody on
the table, he pulled up short.

458
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:46,575
For the rest of his life

459
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:50,774
I remember him sayin' the bitch
weren't worth more than a pinkie.

460
00:30:53,168 --> 00:30:54,451
But it was too late then.

461
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:57,079
You can try that
if you have a mind.

462
00:30:58,577 --> 00:30:59,720
I dunno, Butchie.

463
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:02,614
A little somethin' less dramatical.

464
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:04,507
Ya feel me?

465
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,706
You told Brianna she could go
downtown with this?

466
00:31:09,738 --> 00:31:11,756
D'Angelo's her son,
how was I gonna stop her?

467
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:14,086
Look, look there's no harm done

468
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:16,293
if she just keeps
her mouth shut and just listens.

469
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:17,560
Naw, naw.
It's fucked up.

470
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:20,737
There ain't no call messin'
with Brianna with this bullshit.

471
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:21,864
What can you do?

472
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:22,536
I dunno.

473
00:31:22,552 --> 00:31:25,399
File a kinda complaint against
the detective or some shit. I dunno.

474
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:26,010
Harassment?

475
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:29,170
This the same motherfucker
that had Avon's case.

476
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:32,568
Same motherfucker that's comin' at me
in my print shop talkin' shit.

477
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:35,244
An' now he's comin' up
at Brianna with this bullshit?

478
00:31:35,525 --> 00:31:37,356
A complaint's
not going to do anything.

479
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,218
And the fact is

480
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:42,058
if the cops are saying
her son might not be a suicide

481
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:44,029
Brianna's gonna
hear this out regardless.

482
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:48,222
I suppose Avon
should know about it, though.

483
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:51,841
Yeah, well, I'll handle that.

484
00:32:05,647 --> 00:32:07,305
Not much slinging going on here.

485
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:09,511
Western boys are sittin'
on the real estate.

486
00:32:14,774 --> 00:32:17,246
Yeah... a-ight, a-ight.
That'll work, too.

487
00:32:18,373 --> 00:32:18,827
A- ight.

488
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,209
Yo, Shamrock says we should
take some of our people down

489
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,603
to Hamsterdam and sell off there.

490
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:26,544
At least until these knockos
roll up off some of these corners.

491
00:32:27,264 --> 00:32:27,671
C'mon.

492
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:35,244
Car stop, maybe?

493
00:32:35,526 --> 00:32:36,355
Why not?

494
00:33:02,235 --> 00:33:03,659
Not yet, you fuckin' rodent.

495
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:19,744
You all can't do this, man.
We headin' to Hamsterdam.

496
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,012
You come off that car again

497
00:33:21,027 --> 00:33:23,421
an' you goin' to Bon Secours
emergency room. You hear me?

498
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:25,233
Yo, officer,
we got immunity from y'all.

499
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,688
We goin' to the free zone.

500
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,096
What the fuck's the free zone?

501
00:33:29,504 --> 00:33:30,098
Ho shit.

502
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,038
Packaged for sale.

503
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:32,835
Hey, straight up.

504
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:35,182
Why you think we headed
there in the first place?

505
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:36,919
Headed where?

506
00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:37,873
Hamsterdam.

507
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:39,290
Suck my dick!

508
00:33:45,939 --> 00:33:48,207
Hey, y'all wanna see a wagon!

509
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,042
Fuck y'all!

510
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:51,389
You just shut the fuck up
and cut this shit out now!

511
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:01,832
Like you said.

512
00:34:03,553 --> 00:34:04,492
That's your receipt.

513
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:08,012
Two-forty-four for
the hoop comes back to me

514
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:10,594
rounding to two
and a half for my gas money.

515
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:12,503
This repays me.

516
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:15,194
The rest of this?

517
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,572
Use it to pay
them hoppers for the week.

518
00:34:17,603 --> 00:34:19,981
Whether you use 'em or not,
you pay this money out.

519
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,395
Shit is like
unemployment insurance.

520
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,272
Every employer got to pay in.

521
00:34:24,476 --> 00:34:26,087
And if I find out anybody holding out

522
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:28,950
he's out of here and back on the street
gettin' his head busted.

523
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:32,037
Least y'all can do is look after
your own people a little bit.

524
00:34:33,883 --> 00:34:35,432
What are you a fuckin' communist?

525
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,015
<i>23 o' four. Need a couple of 10-16s,
to Fayette west of Vincent. </i>

526
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,963
That's right around
the corner from here.

527
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:42,606
<i>Ten-four, units responding. </i>

528
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:53,018
The fuck happened?

529
00:34:53,534 --> 00:34:54,176
Car stop.

530
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,569
I got a g-pack from beneath
the passenger seat.

531
00:34:56,585 --> 00:35:00,089
Yo, we was on our way to Hamsterdam
an' the man say we don't get hassled

532
00:35:00,121 --> 00:35:01,591
comin' in or goin' out.
Was' up?

533
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:03,203
What the fuck is Hamsterdam?

534
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:04,580
<i>Lyin' ass poh-leece!</i>

535
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,426
I can't let you do this.

536
00:35:06,535 --> 00:35:08,037
Carv, they got a g-pack.

537
00:35:08,288 --> 00:35:10,713
On the way to the free zone, they did.
You know the rules.

538
00:35:10,728 --> 00:35:12,903
Yeah, man, and I was tryin'
to tell these people...

539
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:13,670
Shut the fuck up.

540
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:16,603
<i>700 to any unit at the scene
at Fayette and Vincent. </i>

541
00:35:16,634 --> 00:35:17,370
Yeah, boss.

542
00:35:18,152 --> 00:35:19,468
<i>You got a situation there?</i>

543
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:21,439
I can't believe this bullshit.

544
00:35:21,564 --> 00:35:22,957
Yeah, bullshit is right.

545
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,443
I told you to shut the fuck up.

546
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:27,150
Yo, man, y'all gave your fuckin' word.
You know you did, man.

547
00:35:27,165 --> 00:35:28,542
This is so fuckin' bullshit.

548
00:35:28,652 --> 00:35:30,018
Y'all some fuckin' liar'y man.

549
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:32,787
Carv, will you please tell me
what the fuck is going on here?

550
00:35:34,555 --> 00:35:35,822
Major said he's on his way.

551
00:35:38,607 --> 00:35:39,308
Carv?

552
00:35:44,064 --> 00:35:44,925
Oh, man.

553
00:35:58,943 --> 00:35:59,913
Sure that's the one?

554
00:36:00,335 --> 00:36:01,927
Reesie say that was the one.

555
00:36:02,444 --> 00:36:04,086
Who am I to say different.

556
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:09,922
Tell him I ain't gonna pay
'til it proves itself though.

557
00:36:09,938 --> 00:36:11,142
I told him that already.

558
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:13,751
He say 1500 for his trouble.

559
00:36:14,893 --> 00:36:15,394
Damn.

560
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:18,601
Conscience do cost.

561
00:36:40,594 --> 00:36:41,569
I seen him, Bernard.

562
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:45,058
You hadn't even gone past the damn door
and he threw all the papers in the trash.

563
00:36:45,073 --> 00:36:46,278
You lyin' now, I can tell.

564
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:48,249
You is the only one
who gives a fuck.

565
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:50,299
An' if you hadn't been
the stupidest mothercker

566
00:36:50,314 --> 00:36:52,650
that I ever gone out with,
you'd just would have bought

567
00:36:52,665 --> 00:36:54,246
a whole bunchaf them
things at once.

568
00:36:54,261 --> 00:36:56,812
Only need like six more.
We be done in, like, half an hour.

569
00:36:56,874 --> 00:37:00,504
How 'bout we make one more
stop you get six of them shits

570
00:37:00,535 --> 00:37:02,945
and I suck your dick
for the next 20 minutes.

571
00:37:23,215 --> 00:37:23,794
Gotcha.

572
00:37:25,874 --> 00:37:26,547
Fuck.

573
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,269
Fuck y'all.

574
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:32,023
Shit. I worked a double, man.

575
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,862
<i>Bunk, line three. </i>

576
00:37:39,774 --> 00:37:40,963
Detective Moreland.

577
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:42,943
Heard you lookin' for something.

578
00:37:48,086 --> 00:37:50,105
Lemme get some of them
Trac phones activated.

579
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,059
Eight of 'em bitches.

580
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:03,641
This one for sector two.

581
00:38:04,893 --> 00:38:07,756
Sector one, I'm using the empty
low-rise housing on Winchester.

582
00:38:08,209 --> 00:38:09,790
Sector three, the old Koppers plant.

583
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,401
And it's legal to sell here?

584
00:38:11,697 --> 00:38:12,386
It's not legal.

585
00:38:14,498 --> 00:38:15,968
We just look the other way is all.

586
00:38:16,266 --> 00:38:17,236
How? How can you?

587
00:38:17,627 --> 00:38:19,520
I know it hurts your heads
to think about it

588
00:38:19,535 --> 00:38:21,601
but before you decide
to lose your minds on this

589
00:38:21,648 --> 00:38:24,594
take a moment, ride around to my corners,
my worst drug corners.

590
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:28,552
Edmondson and Brice.
North and Pulaski. Hollins and Payson.

591
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:29,945
They're empty.

592
00:38:30,946 --> 00:38:31,681
All of them.

593
00:38:33,263 --> 00:38:35,289
District-wide, my crime
is down five percent.

594
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:36,705
But do the bosses know?

595
00:38:37,112 --> 00:38:38,927
No, the bosses
don't know shit about it.

596
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:42,228
This is just a district commander,
taking an initiative on his own.

597
00:38:42,297 --> 00:38:43,440
Jesus christ!

598
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,914
I knew it was only a matter
of time before I bumped into

599
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,400
somebody from downtown about this.

600
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:51,747
And I know your natural
impulse is to take what you saw

601
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:53,797
back downtown with you,
but I gotta ask you...

602
00:38:53,828 --> 00:38:54,873
You legalized drugs?

603
00:38:54,951 --> 00:38:57,267
Look, this is a tactical deployment.

604
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,896
We just wait for everything
to get settled down here

605
00:39:00,912 --> 00:39:02,727
in these three zones
and then we move.

606
00:39:04,868 --> 00:39:07,012
Look, we make a big show
of lockin' everybody up

607
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:08,232
and then we shut it down.

608
00:39:13,207 --> 00:39:15,210
I'm sorry I had to
fuck you up on that arrest

609
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:20,506
and I'm sorry you had to see us
give that runt back the g-pack.

610
00:39:20,522 --> 00:39:21,507
That was ugly, I know.

611
00:39:23,776 --> 00:39:26,253
But I'm just tryin' to save
what's left of my district

612
00:39:26,268 --> 00:39:27,895
anyway I can, if I can.

613
00:39:28,553 --> 00:39:31,056
And the longer I have before
I have to brief the bosses

614
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:32,245
about this deployment...

615
00:39:32,276 --> 00:39:34,310
We got all we needed
from the car stop, major.

616
00:39:34,326 --> 00:39:35,066
Don't sweat it.

617
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:40,479
Let me get a word
with my old commander.

618
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,455
I dunno, Major.

619
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:51,992
Whenever you bust this place up,
they'll go back to their same corners.

620
00:39:52,649 --> 00:39:54,933
Besides, you were never
much on making a big show.

621
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:02,359
If this doesn't work, Jimmy,
we're back to the usual

622
00:40:02,515 --> 00:40:04,456
and I'm out the door
on a pension anyway.

623
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:07,850
But, Jimmy, I need more time.

624
00:40:09,008 --> 00:40:11,949
I need to be able to rely on you
and your people to keep this close.

625
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:16,611
The bosses don't know, huh?

626
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:22,390
Fuck the bosses.

627
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,308
You the man who called?

628
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:43,883
I did.

629
00:40:49,124 --> 00:40:50,543
You witnessin' or what?

630
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,785
I'm afraid I'm blind.

631
00:40:58,131 --> 00:40:58,976
Legally.

632
00:41:03,638 --> 00:41:05,187
Something you need to see though.

633
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:19,850
Glock 40, I believe.

634
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:31,316
I suppose you ain't going to tell me
who brought this here, right?

635
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:32,317
Like I say

636
00:41:33,334 --> 00:41:34,301
I'm blind.

637
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:38,854
I thought you might know, though.

638
00:41:49,991 --> 00:41:51,196
You tell him for me

639
00:41:52,213 --> 00:41:54,607
I'm hopin' he might need
this in court some day.

640
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:10,520
Knockos might come back.

641
00:42:11,647 --> 00:42:12,398
They might.

642
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:16,043
But until they do,
this your corner to hold.

643
00:42:16,425 --> 00:42:17,818
What about Marlo's crew?

644
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:21,119
Look, Avon's home,
and you on a Barksdale corner.

645
00:42:21,135 --> 00:42:22,167
Ya feel me?

646
00:42:22,965 --> 00:42:24,233
Avon ain't here now.

647
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:25,375
You got muscle.

648
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:27,855
Don't worry about that, little man.

649
00:42:37,552 --> 00:42:37,959
Hey...

650
00:42:40,212 --> 00:42:42,371
the burner of young Bodie Broadus

651
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:44,843
it still has minutes left.

652
00:42:47,346 --> 00:42:48,207
Speed dial?

653
00:42:55,002 --> 00:42:55,769
Caroline.

654
00:42:56,426 --> 00:42:58,976
You wouldn't have an extra room
at your place, would you?

655
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:03,147
Jus' for a night or two,
'til I can get my shit together.

656
00:43:03,523 --> 00:43:04,540
Ain't no fixin' it?

657
00:43:05,932 --> 00:43:07,481
It's fixed pretty good, I think.

658
00:43:11,683 --> 00:43:12,183
Thanks.

659
00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:21,226
Credit card was a business account
listed to a Theresa D'Agostino.

660
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:22,641
Yeah, that's her.

661
00:43:24,174 --> 00:43:25,254
What kinda business?

662
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,741
Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.

663
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,588
Billing on the card goes
to a business address

664
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:31,668
in northwest Washington.

665
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:34,553
I called the switchboard
and she's listed.

666
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:42,673
D'Agostino doesn't sound much
like a west Baltimore name to me.

667
00:43:43,209 --> 00:43:43,850
Me either.

668
00:43:48,716 --> 00:43:51,266
Truth is, I don't know what I want.

669
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,629
I'm know I'm lookin' for somethin'

670
00:43:54,129 --> 00:43:56,339
but I can't even
tell you what it is.

671
00:43:57,763 --> 00:43:59,359
I understand you found work.

672
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,566
Ain't no payroll job, but it'll do.

673
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:06,728
You ain't here for a job.

674
00:44:07,385 --> 00:44:09,200
Or the G.E.D. program.

675
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:11,672
So you lookin' to join the church?

676
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,852
I, um...

677
00:44:18,745 --> 00:44:19,778
I just...

678
00:44:21,749 --> 00:44:24,111
I've had this feelin'
for a long time

679
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,657
and it's like
I'm standing outside myself

680
00:44:30,345 --> 00:44:33,334
watching me do things
I don't wanna do, you know?

681
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,618
Jus' seein' me like
I'm somebody else

682
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,544
but never ever bein' able
to stop the show.

683
00:44:45,144 --> 00:44:45,973
I'm tired.

684
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:49,176
It's Cutty, right?

685
00:44:51,257 --> 00:44:52,071
Naw, man.

686
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:54,198
Dennis.

687
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,404
She's left, huh?

688
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,325
I figured that because, ah,
I'm supposed to meet her actually.

689
00:45:01,906 --> 00:45:02,844
Tonight, yeah...

690
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:06,521
right, exactly.

691
00:45:08,836 --> 00:45:10,859
I was going to pick her up
and take her to that

692
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:11,876
but I'm running late...

693
00:45:12,893 --> 00:45:14,895
Yeah, yeah, I know...

694
00:45:16,491 --> 00:45:17,477
Where is that exactly?

695
00:45:17,493 --> 00:45:19,464
I'm not really familiar
with that part of...

696
00:45:25,645 --> 00:45:28,633
Too many damn scheduling
conflicts, unfortunately.

697
00:45:28,806 --> 00:45:31,126
But we have put it
on the agenda for the next meeting

698
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:33,645
of the coordinating council
on criminal justice.

699
00:45:34,553 --> 00:45:36,211
You're sentencing it to committee?

700
00:45:37,212 --> 00:45:40,453
Mr. Mayor, we're probably only talking,
like, a few hundred thousand to start.

701
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:43,097
I'm not saying we should create
new identities for these people

702
00:45:43,113 --> 00:45:44,897
and send 'em to New
Mexico like the feds.

703
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:46,852
We just need to get them
out of harm's way.

704
00:45:46,884 --> 00:45:48,417
Lemme tell you something,
Councilman.

705
00:45:48,432 --> 00:45:50,803
I can't lay my hands on several
hundred thousand dollars

706
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,148
that is not already spoken for.

707
00:45:52,164 --> 00:45:54,964
- Mr. Mayor, I was not...
- What would you have me do, Councilman?

708
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:57,315
Should I divert the money
that's already been budgeted

709
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,630
for snow removal from
the first district this winter?

710
00:45:59,646 --> 00:46:02,040
How 'bout I reduce trash pickup
to once a week citywide

711
00:46:03,254 --> 00:46:05,682
put the witnesses up
at the Hyatt Inner Harbor?

712
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:09,276
I'm not trying to be difficult,
Tommy. Come on...

713
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,572
the city in the
financial situation it's in

714
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:14,578
very few friends in Annapolis

715
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:17,757
we've done all we can do
with this matter for now.

716
00:46:18,883 --> 00:46:19,646
Okay, then.

717
00:46:23,517 --> 00:46:24,654
Thanks for your time.

718
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:25,687
Gentlemen.

719
00:46:54,214 --> 00:46:55,118
Nah, what the fuck.

720
00:47:06,939 --> 00:47:09,696
I dunno, boss. If there weren't
so many fucking kids down here

721
00:47:09,707 --> 00:47:10,763
I might be okay with it.

722
00:47:21,703 --> 00:47:22,524
Baltimore police.

723
00:47:23,321 --> 00:47:23,962
Baltimore?

724
00:47:24,607 --> 00:47:25,510
Baltimore, Maryland.

725
00:47:38,033 --> 00:47:39,089
Can I get a Jameson's?

726
00:47:39,124 --> 00:47:40,004
Bushmills, okay?

727
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:41,528
That's protestant whiskey.

728
00:47:42,373 --> 00:47:43,699
The price is right, ain't it?

729
00:47:43,957 --> 00:47:44,531
Make it neat.

730
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:16,247
Excuse me.

731
00:48:23,917 --> 00:48:24,351
Hey.

732
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:25,888
Hey.

733
00:48:26,662 --> 00:48:27,764
What are you doing here?

734
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:29,879
I was just asking myself
the same thing.

735
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:32,413
You drive all the way
down here to look at me

736
00:48:32,436 --> 00:48:34,853
from across the room and then leave?
That's kinda creepy.

737
00:48:34,865 --> 00:48:35,733
You looked occupied.

738
00:48:35,815 --> 00:48:37,340
Him?
Honey, that's just business.

739
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,225
This ain't my kind of crowd.

740
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,152
Definitely not.

741
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:43,134
Yeah, well, I made a mistake,
so I'm gonna go.

742
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:45,398
Four-twenty-eight.

743
00:48:46,806 --> 00:48:47,791
You live in this town.

744
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:49,973
Why book the room?

745
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:51,081
I live across town.

746
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:53,779
As late as these things go,
that's a D.U.I. away.

747
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:56,172
Give me two hours, McNulty.

748
00:48:56,782 --> 00:48:58,284
What am I gonna do for two hours?

749
00:48:59,128 --> 00:48:59,938
Dream on it.

750
00:49:06,637 --> 00:49:07,564
Water's fresh?

751
00:49:09,006 --> 00:49:10,027
You keepin' them cool?

752
00:49:13,401 --> 00:49:15,360
You got squeakers nestin' squabs.

753
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:20,380
Takin' care of the younguns,
I like seein' that.

754
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:23,418
Yeah, Marlo, he's real loyal.

755
00:49:24,505 --> 00:49:25,972
You can't kick him off that nest.

756
00:49:26,382 --> 00:49:27,004
Good work.

757
00:49:28,447 --> 00:49:29,585
That's really good work.

758
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:31,790
Police comin' off them corners.

759
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:33,573
I seen.

760
00:49:36,177 --> 00:49:38,439
I'm gonna keep my name off
the package for a time

761
00:49:38,781 --> 00:49:39,766
keep wholesalin'.

762
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:42,253
You know, step back a bit.

763
00:49:43,437 --> 00:49:44,974
Barksdale gonna think we weak

764
00:49:46,006 --> 00:49:47,601
not comin' out
to claim what's ours.

765
00:49:49,701 --> 00:49:52,329
The police leave them corners,
he's gonna be back out there.

766
00:49:52,387 --> 00:49:53,291
I know he will.

767
00:49:59,021 --> 00:49:59,807
Your turn, girl.

768
00:50:00,463 --> 00:50:01,648
It's a bout time.

769
00:50:02,223 --> 00:50:02,739
For real.

770
00:50:05,798 --> 00:50:06,853
For starters

771
00:50:07,287 --> 00:50:10,971
its memory holds the last 10 calls
made and received by the user.

772
00:50:11,112 --> 00:50:12,848
That's enough
to give us a signature.

773
00:50:13,246 --> 00:50:13,915
Signature?

774
00:50:13,974 --> 00:50:15,956
The phone numbers
unique to an individual.

775
00:50:16,109 --> 00:50:19,211
That way we can identify the user
when he switches to another phone.

776
00:50:20,513 --> 00:50:22,589
Sorry, I'm late.
Woke up in the wrong town.

777
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,220
Anyway, we ran the tolls
on those numbers

778
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:30,070
and we came up with
a rather interesting pattern.

779
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:31,337
Check this out.

780
00:50:31,372 --> 00:50:33,765
This is the pattern of a clod
communication network.

781
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:36,272
Something you would expect
from a drug organization.

782
00:50:36,718 --> 00:50:42,079
This particular one so far
involves 15 distinct burners.

783
00:50:42,337 --> 00:50:42,935
15.

784
00:50:44,038 --> 00:50:46,769
And none of them list
subscriber information.

785
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:47,590
You can do that?

786
00:50:47,613 --> 00:50:49,842
With these burners,
with this particular company

787
00:50:49,877 --> 00:50:51,649
you don't need
subscriber information.

788
00:50:52,751 --> 00:50:58,130
Our data shows that over 92% of the calls
are made within this network

789
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:00,593
with the average call
lasting less than a minute.

790
00:51:00,945 --> 00:51:03,373
Again, suggestive
of drug trafficking.

791
00:51:04,335 --> 00:51:07,876
This user here,
he serves as a clearing house.

792
00:51:07,935 --> 00:51:10,280
He receives calls,
and initiates interactions.

793
00:51:10,281 --> 00:51:11,606
He coordinates the show.

794
00:51:11,817 --> 00:51:13,108
Be nice if that was Stringer.

795
00:51:14,034 --> 00:51:16,822
Now this is the best part,
this is something that Prez discovered

796
00:51:16,857 --> 00:51:18,019
when he was playing with it.

797
00:51:18,054 --> 00:51:20,107
It has a speed dial feature.

798
00:51:24,808 --> 00:51:29,078
Meaning, someone took
the time to program the phone.

799
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:31,612
Hell, that's probably
the only way these corner boys

800
00:51:31,623 --> 00:51:32,890
can remember all the numbers

801
00:51:32,961 --> 00:51:35,494
what with these phones being
dumped every few days or so.

802
00:51:36,448 --> 00:51:39,357
I'll bet all the other phones
in the network are set up the same way.

803
00:51:39,381 --> 00:51:40,413
Well I've heard enough.

804
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:42,196
We should start writing for the wire.

805
00:51:42,313 --> 00:51:43,216
When can we get up?

806
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:44,155
Get up on what?

807
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:46,450
They're dumping phones
every couple weeks on average.

808
00:51:46,474 --> 00:51:49,066
By the time you get a wire up
on that, the phones are dead.

809
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:52,011
The whole network
shuts down simultaneously.

810
00:51:54,753 --> 00:51:55,774
Do we have a plan?

811
00:51:55,973 --> 00:51:57,052
Not yet we don't.

812
00:51:57,545 --> 00:52:00,184
But for now, if I could get a couple more
of these dead phones

813
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:02,847
it'll probably help corroborate
the theory for the affidavit.

814
00:52:02,964 --> 00:52:05,342
Kima, maybe you could ask
those western boys to pick up

815
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:07,574
what they find on the ground
for the next few days.

816
00:52:07,629 --> 00:52:08,286
Yeah, sure.

817
00:52:13,122 --> 00:52:15,550
Damn boy, you smell like sex.

818
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:17,849
You didn't take a fucking shower?

819
00:52:17,978 --> 00:52:18,916
Late for work.

820
00:52:25,317 --> 00:52:26,912
You forgot my Newports,
didn't you?

821
00:52:26,924 --> 00:52:29,105
Aw shit, man. I did, yo.

822
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:32,190
Lemme do up these chips
an' then I'll go get your cigs.

823
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:04,816
Fuck.

824
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:15,453
<i>Three one, shooting
at the number one Mayo. </i>

825
00:53:15,617 --> 00:53:17,389
<i>We're gonna need
some suits down here. </i>

826
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:19,952
<i>For investigation? I'm on my way. </i>

827
00:53:21,019 --> 00:53:21,864
<i>Roger, 10 hundred. </i>

828
00:53:21,887 --> 00:53:22,603
Back so soon.

829
00:53:23,002 --> 00:53:25,723
I thought you guys had enough
of our happy district yesterday.

830
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:27,104
Just need a favor.

831
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,966
Lester wants you to scoop up
any discarded cell phones

832
00:53:29,978 --> 00:53:31,514
you find on Barksdale corners.

833
00:53:31,714 --> 00:53:33,250
You want Barksdale license plates.

834
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:35,397
- Tag numbers and all?
- Whatever, sure.

835
00:53:35,651 --> 00:53:38,138
'Cause I saw the big man
riding in a truck the other day.

836
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:40,015
Missed the tag,
but if I see him again...

837
00:53:40,108 --> 00:53:40,707
Stringer?

838
00:53:41,434 --> 00:53:43,358
- Naw, the other guy.
- What other guy?

839
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:45,023
Big boy, the one we locked up.

840
00:53:45,941 --> 00:53:47,489
- Avon.
- Avon Barksdale?

841
00:53:47,888 --> 00:53:51,125
Jesus, Herc. He's at Jessup,
down for four or five at least.

842
00:53:51,536 --> 00:53:53,002
What, we all look alike to you?

843
00:53:53,413 --> 00:53:54,800
If you don't believe me fuck it.

844
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:56,205
No fuckin' way...

845
00:53:57,188 --> 00:53:58,655
but the fact remains

846
00:53:58,983 --> 00:54:02,760
we would not be returning
this service weapon to this officer

847
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,350
without help from the citizens
of Baltimore as well.

848
00:54:07,213 --> 00:54:10,955
And on that note, I think our Mayor
would like to say a few words.

849
00:54:16,404 --> 00:54:17,718
Thank you, Commissioner Burrell.

850
00:54:17,765 --> 00:54:20,745
I just want to take this opportunity
to commend our department

851
00:54:20,768 --> 00:54:23,138
on successfully resolving this case

852
00:54:23,642 --> 00:54:28,002
and to wish officer Dozerman
a speedy return to duty.

853
00:54:31,357 --> 00:54:32,272
<i>Officer Dozerman</i>

854
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,409
<i>the citizens want you
to have this back</i>

855
00:54:37,497 --> 00:54:41,063
<i>and to thank you for your
service in defense of our city. </i>

856
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:47,288
<i>and I especially want to thank all
of our concerned residents</i>

857
00:54:47,804 --> 00:54:51,042
<i>who called into the hotline.
We would not be here today... </i>

858
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:09,620
Lester.

859
00:55:10,324 --> 00:55:12,365
Lieutenant, you gotta see this.

860
00:55:24,211 --> 00:55:25,325
Big joke.

861
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:33,293
