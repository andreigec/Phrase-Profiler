1
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,810
All that from overnight?

2
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:38,710
All that from Freamon.

3
00:00:38,768 --> 00:00:41,062
He's out early today
rooting through empties.

4
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:46,023
You know what he is?
He is a vandal.

5
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,906
He is vandalizing the board.

6
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,612
He is vandalizing this unit.

7
00:00:51,788 --> 00:00:56,809
He is a hun, a Visigoth,
a barbarian at the gate

8
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:01,143
clamoring for noble roman blood
and what's left of our clearance rate.

9
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:03,896
And you sit here
doing what exactly?

10
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,209
A hotshot maybe.

11
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:08,004
We got a sack in the boxes.
He owns one from a couple days ago.

12
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,186
White coat alley.

13
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:11,127
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

14
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:15,339
Is everybody on a crusade
to make more murders out of bullshit?

15
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,131
The mope's confessing, Jay.

16
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,220
He walked up
to the western desk to do it.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,345
Well, at least when you go
to manufacturing a murder, Eddie,

18
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:25,111
you already have a suspect in hand.

19
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:27,055
I respect that part of your game.

20
00:01:28,702 --> 00:01:30,273
Oh, that others might learn.

21
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,162
I need a witness for the statement
in box number one.

22
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,676
Yeah. Let me dump my shit.

23
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:36,304
I'll be there.

24
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:41,670
Sodium cyanide.

25
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:44,771
You're telling me
we do a full tox screen on this kid.

26
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:46,652
He comes back positive for cyanide.

27
00:01:46,768 --> 00:01:50,139
Yeah.
That's what I'm saying, OK.

28
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:54,739
You need to lock me up
because I killed that boy.

29
00:01:54,778 --> 00:01:55,863
I did.

30
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:57,104
I did.

31
00:01:57,162 --> 00:02:00,749
So just-- Just lock me up
and be done with. Right?

32
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:03,049
Where'd you get the cyanide?

33
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,586
You getting sick there, Bunky?

34
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:13,767
When's the last time
you had your medicine?

35
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:16,818
No.

36
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:19,959
Naw, I'm not getting high anymore.
OK?

37
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:21,362
Let me ask you again.

38
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:23,669
Where'd you get cyanide from?

39
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:24,921
If you're saying--

40
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:26,938
Fuck!

41
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,791
Shit.
He got my fucking sleeve.

42
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:32,323
Just calm down.

43
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:35,245
We'll get something to clean this up
and maybe a soda or something.

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,765
- Get some sugar in you at least.
- Please, lord.

45
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:42,282
He settles down,
I'll miranda.

46
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:43,611
Yeah.

47
00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:48,399
Fuck.

48
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:25,867
Steals like my ex-wife's lawyer.

49
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:32,096
Jesus.

50
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,179
Get up there.

51
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:36,555
Come on. Come on.
Come on!

52
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:37,691
Give me a sec!

53
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:58,074
Call 911. The muttonbox in one
just tried to hang himself.

54
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:09,835
4x13 Final Grades

55
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:49,044
No idea on this one.

56
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:53,503
Two on this block
and 3 off Lanvale.

57
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:55,501
They cluster.

58
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:58,691
And when they found a block they liked,
they came back on it.

59
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:02,250
One on the next block,
across Gilmore.

60
00:06:03,374 --> 00:06:04,692
That makes 9.

61
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,254
Scary thing is we're only
looking at one district.

62
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:09,581
Shit. One sector.

63
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:13,569
How far you think
they might have roamed?

64
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:17,850
There's only one way to find out.

65
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,354
Excuse me.
Dennis.

66
00:06:25,547 --> 00:06:27,060
How we doing with forensics?

67
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,561
That's the Colonel's domain,
but my understanding is

68
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:33,198
that we're sending a lab team
to every house.

69
00:06:33,857 --> 00:06:36,013
So far we're finding
9-millimeter casings.

70
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:37,641
Once they start scoping
at the morgues,

71
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,048
we'll probably have slugs
to go with them.

72
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:44,013
Trace-wise, we're laser printing
around every body and vacuuming

73
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,130
every crime scene for hair and fiber,
but, of course, these are vacant.

74
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:51,897
It'll take our lab a year
to sift that many bags of dirt.

75
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:55,232
Is this all from one drug crew?

76
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:56,890
Probably.

77
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:59,236
- Marlo Stanfield's bunch.
- Where are we on them?

78
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:02,220
Major crimes was working wiretaps
until 3 months ago,

79
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,653
but we came down on those.

80
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:06,223
Can we get back up?

81
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:09,739
Trying, but Stanfield's people
may have changed up the pattern.

82
00:07:09,932 --> 00:07:12,763
Well, Colonel,
whatever you need.

83
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:16,834
Actually, what I need is patrol.

84
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:18,686
Patrol division?

85
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:20,443
That was detective Freeman
on the phone.

86
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:23,312
We found two more at Lafayette
and another on Lanvale.

87
00:07:23,797 --> 00:07:25,232
Jesus Christ.

88
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:27,919
Now starting at the first scene,
we've been going door to door,

89
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,478
but there's no telling how far
she would have wandered.

90
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:32,531
And with 15,000 vacants in the city,

91
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:35,338
It'll take my people weeks
to cover that ground.

92
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:44,934
He brings this case in,
he'll be closer to the throne.

93
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,160
Look, I wouldn't worry about Daniels.

94
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:51,947
He's a long way from my chair,
as are you.

95
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:55,694
You made your move too soon.

96
00:07:58,718 --> 00:07:59,901
I did.

97
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:02,878
Politics doesn't suit you.
Stick to operations.

98
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,318
And don't you ever cross me
like that again.

99
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:14,405
Get it out to all the wards.

100
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:18,341
Leander, go downtown.

101
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,215
Run a flier for every roll call.

102
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:23,990
Show them the nails and
the screws in detail. All right?

103
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:26,665
You grab a couple of those nails
and hit all the hardware stores.

104
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:29,100
Find out exactly what the model
is that we're looking for.

105
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:30,186
What do you need from me?

106
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:31,213
Herc.

107
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,187
I'm serious. Get hold of him.

108
00:08:39,762 --> 00:08:40,809
How's he looking?

109
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:42,050
Pretty good considering.

110
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,833
No worse than before he hung himself.

111
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:47,550
Where the fuck are you going?

112
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:50,303
West side.
Freeman found another.

113
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:53,791
Fucking Freeman.

114
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:56,263
He a transport?

115
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,445
Borderline.

116
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:58,996
B.P. And pulse are normal.

117
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:00,866
We gave him ativan
for withdrawal.

118
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,047
You want to go to a hospital?

119
00:09:13,017 --> 00:09:14,316
Let me ask you something.

120
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,767
What kind of a fellow rigs up a hotshot

121
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:20,292
then walks into a police station
to talk about it?

122
00:09:21,552 --> 00:09:22,696
What's that?

123
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:24,363
You want us to wait?

124
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:25,484
Naw.

125
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,458
What is in your head, fellow?

126
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,710
Hotshot and this other motherfucker,
they were beating on me.

127
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:49,911
And the boy?

128
00:09:57,214 --> 00:09:58,423
He was dipping.

129
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,850
I knew he was.

130
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,818
I just didn't--
I didn't think...

131
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,371
the child had no one for him.

132
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,298
No mother, no family.

133
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:21,317
He in the street
like I'm in the street.

134
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:24,419
I tried to, um...

135
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,933
like I ain't
who I am, right?

136
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,833
Like I'm pretending I ain't been
a dope fiend my whole damn life.

137
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,374
Just lock me up, man.

138
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:01,044
'Cause I killed that child.

139
00:11:34,074 --> 00:11:35,721
The shot wasn't for the kid.

140
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,006
Let's throw this one back.

141
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,663
This sad-ass motherfucker's carrying
more weight than we'll ever put on him.

142
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:47,079
What about the clearance?

143
00:11:49,657 --> 00:11:51,763
- Fuck the clearance.
- Cut him loose?

144
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,167
Shit, he'll go off
a roof or some shit.

145
00:11:54,205 --> 00:11:55,853
My luck, I'll catch that call, too.

146
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:59,733
Maybe he were over at Bayview.
Something with soft balls.

147
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:03,810
Is you out of your mind, nigger?

148
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:06,504
You think I'm gonna pay twice for
the same motherfucking package?

149
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,075
Hey, I'm in the same box here.

150
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:10,148
Faggot took my shit
same as he took y'all's.

151
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:11,990
Man, but that's on your own people.

152
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:14,378
Your guys was the ones doing
security on this shit.

153
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:18,045
Hey, they worked it the same as
we did the last dozen shipments.

154
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:20,737
Y'all was fine with it
up until this, right?

155
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,832
Ain't no one have a problem with it
till the motherfucker gave us one.

156
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,546
Thing is, Joe,
we called a quorum on this.

157
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:29,667
Took a vote that says it's your
people need to make this right.

158
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:32,924
Naw, naw, a co-op means
share and share alike.

159
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,250
You share the good,
and you share the bad.

160
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:41,467
All right.

161
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:46,701
I'll dig deep and do the full
shipment if that's what y'all need,

162
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,451
But don't even think about coming
back to me for a re-up after this.

163
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:54,055
'Cause when that good raw shit
comes straight off the boat,

164
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:57,234
It's gonna be mine only,
seeing as how y'all can't find

165
00:12:57,273 --> 00:12:59,018
the heart to stand with me now.

166
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:07,497
You want to quorum up again,
think it over a little?

167
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,325
Yeah. I thought you might.

168
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:16,374
I'll get word back
that we need a fresh shipment

169
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:17,727
and right quick,

170
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:21,071
and you can think about
what we need to do to improve security.

171
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:24,033
Make sure it only happens the once.

172
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:39,594
What's up?

173
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:50,208
Which one of your people was
in charge of the stash?

174
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:52,903
I want to talk to him.

175
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,454
My nephew.

176
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,278
My sister's boy.

177
00:13:57,345 --> 00:13:59,088
I can't give him up like that.

178
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,015
I can't do it.

179
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:06,471
My connect had people there
when the shit went down.

180
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:08,797
If that's what you need
to make you believe,

181
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:10,428
you can hear it straight from him.

182
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,290
Mi gente.

183
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:44,841
We are rich.

184
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:46,993
That's what I'm talking about.

185
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:53,318
Butch.

186
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,533
My man.

187
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:05,912
Now, girl, you set that off slow,
you feel me?

188
00:15:06,131 --> 00:15:08,787
'Cause word gonna get around.
They gonna come back on you now.

189
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:10,124
Naw. None of that.

190
00:15:10,396 --> 00:15:15,097
Yo, anybody ask about me on another job,
tell them, "Kimmy been retired."

191
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:16,473
All right?

192
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:18,555
Be easy.

193
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:23,121
How much you got left after
splitting with the Mexicans?

194
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:25,350
20 cig roll.

195
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:27,939
Gracious.

196
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:31,534
Shit, only problem, man,
I'll spend the rest of my life

197
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:33,221
trying to put that out on the street.

198
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:36,055
I ain't no drugdealer, Butch.
You feel me?

199
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,390
Shoot. We done stole
too much this damn time.

200
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:45,483
So, what am I gonna do, Butch?

201
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,223
You could come give Joe a call.

202
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:55,956
Offer to sell the shit back to him now

203
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:58,230
for 20 cents on the dollar.

204
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,875
Joe would have found
some humor in that.

205
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:04,174
I know you do.

206
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:16,927
I understand there's a waiting list.

207
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,937
The thing is this kid has
already been in a foster home.

208
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:23,520
Right. And now his foster
mother's been hospitalized, so--

209
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:27,087
Right. No.

210
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,169
Is there a supervisor
that I can talk to?

211
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:34,096
I'm gonna be a little late for rollcall.

212
00:16:34,135 --> 00:16:36,503
- Gotta get this kid settled.
- What's wrong with D.S.S.?

213
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:39,319
On the phone with them right now.
They're talking about a group home.

214
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:42,189
So? Either you come up with a
guardian or he goes to social services.

215
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:43,674
No two ways about it.

216
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:46,427
Hello? Hello?

217
00:16:57,238 --> 00:16:59,060
Need your help.
Get dressed.

218
00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:02,325
I'm suspended with pay,
pending a full trial board.

219
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:04,477
Can't do nothing for no one, Kima.

220
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:06,067
Fuck what they say.

221
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:09,821
This here's police work,
and I'm asking if you police.

222
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:13,192
All right.
Listen up, you mutts.

223
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,588
This is complicated.

224
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:17,454
I mean, it isn't complicated
if you went to college or--

225
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:20,500
I don't know--
your mothers actually stopped drinking

226
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,287
for a minute while they was pregnant.

227
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:25,200
For Baltimore city police,
this is complicated.

228
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:28,222
Anyway, this right here

229
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:31,884
is for the major crimes
homicide investigation into the bodies

230
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:34,365
being found in the vacant houses
here in western.

231
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:38,105
Command now wants all the districts
to check every vacant in the city.

232
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,916
That means you will need to go door to
door to every vacant house in your post

233
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,126
and look at what was used
to board it up.

234
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:45,822
Most will have the Phillips head screw

235
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,575
that HCD
uses like this here on the flier.

236
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,458
But if you see a house
that's been boarded up

237
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:53,873
with nail-gun nails
like these shown here,

238
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:55,831
Call your sector sergeant immediately.

239
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,362
You can enter the house,
but if you find a body,

240
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:01,613
do not disturb the crime scene.
All told.

241
00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:04,548
But what I don't understand

242
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,778
is why they keep busting
my balls about this.

243
00:18:06,894 --> 00:18:08,686
I mean, Daniels gave me
a slap on the wrist

244
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:10,322
for the thing with the minister, right?

245
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,609
And Marimow got bounced just before
he could fuck me up on anything else.

246
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,509
You sure we on the right block?

247
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:18,688
Yeah. Put them on the curb
right here, more or less.

248
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:22,254
And then you fired the nail gun
into the asphalt right where they sat.

249
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,173
Yeah. Right next to
the little broad's leg.

250
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,449
So who tells these I.I.D. fucks
to start running through

251
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:29,795
my paperwork looking
for who the fuck cares?

252
00:18:29,892 --> 00:18:31,372
It's not like they caught me stealing

253
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:33,367
or brutalizing motherfuckers,
right? Right?

254
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,043
Look.

255
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:40,670
Yeah. It looks like it could be.

256
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:41,911
Is that about right?

257
00:18:44,063 --> 00:18:45,299
Yeah.

258
00:18:45,997 --> 00:18:47,800
Must have worked himself free.

259
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:57,244
I took them nails to ballistics.

260
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,873
Preparer said he could match
anything out of that gun

261
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,012
And maybe the nail gun itself
if we could get it.

262
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:06,366
I mean, I know they're
gonna take my stripes,

263
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:08,867
But you don't think
they're gonna go past that, right?

264
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:10,759
Herc, what'd you do exactly?

265
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,113
Lost the camera I took from I.S.D.

266
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:16,098
without my Lieutenant's approval.

267
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:18,483
And what evidence I got
from the camera,

268
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,010
I put to a made-up informant.

269
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:27,759
Son, they're gonna beat on your
white ass like it's a rented mule.

270
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,389
Fuck.

271
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,189
<i>Then make him sign it.</i>

272
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:36,854
<i>He gets there himself.</i>
<i>That cocksucker.</i>

273
00:19:36,912 --> 00:19:38,114
<i>I hate that bastard.</i>

274
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:40,688
They called him cocksucker.

275
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:44,642
Damn.

276
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:51,233
You're gonna break that call button.

277
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,078
Look, I'm sorry.

278
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:55,869
I don't mean to bother y'all,
but I don't get but 4 channels.

279
00:19:55,966 --> 00:19:57,343
That's all you get.

280
00:19:57,401 --> 00:19:59,154
What about my man over there?

281
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:00,434
He has insurance.

282
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:02,915
And insurance pays
for his cable hookup.

283
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:05,920
Only reason you're admitted
is that fracture.

284
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:08,227
Soon as we can discharge you,
we will.

285
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:13,873
All you gangsters
wash up in our E.R. like it's your due.

286
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,137
You could stand out there
slinging drugs

287
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:17,758
till you get shot or cut,

288
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,045
have us put you back together
free of charge

289
00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:22,771
So you can do it again.

290
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:25,649
- Gangster, huh?
- Oh, you're not that?

291
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:27,549
I pulled your admissions.

292
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:30,325
You were here in '90
for a gunshot wound,

293
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:34,546
And 3 years before that, you were
here for chest surgery for a cutting.

294
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:36,407
Long time back. Yeah.

295
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:38,943
And I see you're still at it.

296
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:43,311
Dennis Wise,
I'm Howard Colvin.

297
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:44,609
Are you police?

298
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,080
I, used to be, but now
I'm a bit of a teacher up at Tillman.

299
00:20:57,481 --> 00:20:58,780
I got a little problem,

300
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:01,475
and you know Carver
over at the western.

301
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:04,109
He said that you might
be able to help me.

302
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:08,595
I went up to your gym.
They told me what happened.

303
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:12,770
What is it that
I'm supposed to know about?

304
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,562
His name is Brice.

305
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,251
Yeah. What's the problem?

306
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,595
I've just come to care about the kid.

307
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,939
You heard it was Little Kevin.

308
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:33,933
Seen one of the police step out
the household his neck was...

309
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:35,600
can't do nothing to me, yo.

310
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:41,400
This motherfucker just be
killing niggers just to do it.

311
00:21:41,923 --> 00:21:46,773
See? Nigger killing
motherfuckers just 'cause he can,

312
00:21:47,063 --> 00:21:50,440
Not 'cause they snitching,
not 'cause it's business,

313
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:53,908
But 'cause this shit
just comes natural to him.

314
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:56,138
- Yo, Bodie, man--
- Little Kevin is gone.

315
00:21:56,797 --> 00:21:58,223
This nigger don't feel nothing.

316
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:00,160
And all them motherfuckers
in them row houses,

317
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,672
nobody mean a fucking thing to him.

318
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,281
I think you need to calm the fuck down.

319
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,728
Fuck Marlo, man.
Fuck him!

320
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:07,830
And anybody that think it's
all right to do people this way.

321
00:22:08,818 --> 00:22:09,945
You hear me?

322
00:22:10,022 --> 00:22:11,534
Fuck all y'all motherfuckers.

323
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,104
Get the fuck off me, man.

324
00:22:14,403 --> 00:22:15,714
That's his friend in the bag.

325
00:22:21,398 --> 00:22:24,326
It's like a nigger
ain't fit, man.

326
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:32,206
You see that shit, yo?

327
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:34,242
Go on. Lock his dumb ass up.

328
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,190
Attica! Attica! Attica!

329
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:42,900
<i>The number of victims discovered shot</i>
<i>to death in the boarded-up buildings.</i>

330
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:44,586
How flattering for us.

331
00:22:44,838 --> 00:22:47,034
Knocks the school deficit
right off the front pages.

332
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:48,623
There's your silver lining right there.

333
00:22:48,662 --> 00:22:50,174
Those bodies are on Royce.

334
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:51,927
School deficits should be, too.

335
00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:54,140
Should be, but that's
a problem that's gonna play out

336
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,407
in the next fiscal year.
By then, you're out of Teflon.

337
00:22:56,504 --> 00:22:57,783
So I take
the Governor's money,

338
00:22:57,841 --> 00:23:00,652
and in two years from now when
I shake the hand of any voter

339
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:02,577
in the D.C. Suburbs,
they say, "all right.

340
00:23:02,578 --> 00:23:06,645
You're the guy who needed my tax
dollars to bail out your school system."

341
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:07,791
You take his check.

342
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,768
He lives both in Prince Georges
and Montgomery,

343
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,959
and you can't beat him statewide
without the counties.

344
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:14,217
but two years from now,
if you're Governor,

345
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,581
You can help the city from Annapolis.

346
00:23:16,698 --> 00:23:18,132
He's the Mayor now.

347
00:23:18,617 --> 00:23:20,789
I agree we can't fix
the city schools,

348
00:23:20,828 --> 00:23:22,805
but we can't let them
get any worse either.

349
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:24,837
Go back to Annapolis.
Heed his shit.

350
00:23:24,973 --> 00:23:26,601
If we lose local control of the schools

351
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:28,327
and the reason, the teachers
will rip you.

352
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,588
But the rest of the city will see,
you did it for them kids.

353
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:33,740
Kids don't vote.

354
00:23:58,222 --> 00:24:00,374
Taking a risk
with our supply, ain't you?

355
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:03,728
I mean, setting up a meeting
with anybody other than us.

356
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:05,525
Got to.

357
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:07,660
My boy Cray reassured us.

358
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:11,104
Boss, you get our boy Marlo
in line on our connect,

359
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:14,702
he might try to go round the co-op,
go round us.

360
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:16,388
You know what I'm saying?

361
00:24:16,543 --> 00:24:19,440
Cautious as those Greeks be,
who you think they gonna trust?

362
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:21,761
They know us.
They don't know him.

363
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,994
Damn.
Look at this nigger coming round.

364
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:29,573
Easy, son. Easy.

365
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,501
I might have known
I'd find you boys in here

366
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:40,839
burning that oil after hours.

367
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:42,719
Nigger, I'm gonna kill you twice.

368
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:46,098
So you don't want your shipment, huh?

369
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,576
Say your piece.

370
00:24:53,155 --> 00:24:55,869
Well, it just so happens
I got some heroin for sale.

371
00:24:56,877 --> 00:24:59,180
Market-wise,
you fellows look like buyers.

372
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,227
You feel me?

373
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,642
This some shameless shit.

374
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:04,117
Oh, ain't no shame on my game, dawg.

375
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:06,657
I'm here about the business.
Ain't that right, Joe?

376
00:25:07,682 --> 00:25:08,845
How much?

377
00:25:09,534 --> 00:25:10,949
20 on the dollar.

378
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,636
10, nigger.

379
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,293
Don't make me say 25, now.

380
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:19,330
That's 400,000.

381
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:24,062
How about, we take
your faggot ass in the back room

382
00:25:24,514 --> 00:25:26,724
and get into some diabolical brutality,

383
00:25:27,404 --> 00:25:29,324
Find out shit
the old-fashioned way?

384
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,719
Feel me?

385
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:33,805
I feel you.
Sounds like a plan.

386
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,009
I don't know though, Joe.
You think old Marlo gonna give it up?

387
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:41,053
20 on the dollar it is.

388
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,525
Say, how's she ticking, Joe?

389
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:17,132
Be in touch.

390
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,343
And he thinks,
I'll help the schools,

391
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:31,963
help the city a lot more
if I'm Governor two years from now.

392
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:35,706
Thinking that way,
it wouldn't just be about me

393
00:26:35,842 --> 00:26:37,199
if I don't take the money.

394
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,933
Are you asking me what I think?

395
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,043
I think you'll do the right thing.

396
00:27:18,431 --> 00:27:19,826
You sure you want to do this?

397
00:27:21,443 --> 00:27:22,762
I don't want to hurt you.

398
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:24,002
You're not hurting me.

399
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,787
Detective Crutchfield,
do you have a moment?

400
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,047
Yes, ma'am.

401
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:39,470
I've got a question in these reports.

402
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:41,863
Were they all found
in the basement?

403
00:28:42,057 --> 00:28:44,422
No, ma'am. We've been finding
most in the basement,

404
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:46,962
But some are on the upper floors, too.

405
00:28:47,446 --> 00:28:51,561
Can you be specific in the 24s,
for my sake anyway?

406
00:28:52,123 --> 00:28:53,887
- You got it.
- Thanks.

407
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:56,725
How many so far?

408
00:28:58,645 --> 00:28:59,943
- 17.
- Christ.

409
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:02,559
That's a lot of red names.

410
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:04,904
It's your first red bull.

411
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:09,463
Yeah. I thought I'd get a nice,
quiet domestic or two to start me off.

412
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,984
We got national press
on this already.

413
00:29:12,145 --> 00:29:13,231
You'll be fine, Rhonnie.

414
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:16,119
Just don't let any of these guys
see you sweating.

415
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:18,651
And your case dropped.

416
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:22,320
Tell Mello to sign off
on your friendly A.S.A.

417
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:27,592
He kicks out a radio car window,
and you want to give him a walk?

418
00:29:30,682 --> 00:29:32,678
What's the date range for decomp?

419
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,764
The one on mount street
looked about a week.

420
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,276
Some a few days.

421
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:41,186
Some are skeleton at this stage.

422
00:29:42,001 --> 00:29:43,067
They all head shots?

423
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,385
Most of them.

424
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:46,110
Black males 15-25?

425
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:48,184
No, some older.

426
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:52,002
We got one in a security guard's
uniform around here somewhere.

427
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,127
You laser print?

428
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,806
Vacuum the rooms?

429
00:29:56,473 --> 00:29:57,509
Yes.

430
00:29:57,586 --> 00:30:00,126
Gluco for blood?
What's the geography?

431
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:02,627
13 on west side.
Baltimore to Winchester.

432
00:30:03,072 --> 00:30:04,198
Schroeder to the Grove.

433
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:07,164
The eastern boys found 4 more
in the houses on Monument street.

434
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,812
- East side?
- Yeah. That threw us.

435
00:30:09,238 --> 00:30:12,055
We're casting a wider net now
searching the vacants citywide.

436
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:14,109
My number's 23 in the office pool.

437
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,854
I still have hope.

438
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:18,730
Hell of a case right here.

439
00:30:19,544 --> 00:30:23,104
You know, if I was police, I don't
think I could lean back on it. You?

440
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:25,050
Not if I was real police.

441
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:28,920
Thank you, detective.

442
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:08,369
Calvin, you done already?

443
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:09,862
Yeah, I'm done.

444
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,293
<i>Attention, proctors, a reminder.</i>

445
00:31:40,471 --> 00:31:44,822
<i>Answer sheets must be turned into</i>
<i>the office by you and only you</i>

446
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,048
<i>immediately</i>
<i>upon completion of the tests.</i>

447
00:31:48,552 --> 00:31:50,430
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

448
00:31:51,468 --> 00:31:52,981
Where are we on the nail gun?

449
00:31:53,185 --> 00:31:54,748
A Hill T.D.X. model.

450
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,648
High end but common
among contractors.

451
00:31:56,668 --> 00:31:59,589
Is it what sergeant Hauk saw
in the back of Chris Partlow's truck?

452
00:31:59,705 --> 00:32:01,566
We showed him one,
and he thought so.

453
00:32:01,894 --> 00:32:04,821
Then we dragged his ass back down
to the block where he did the car stop.

454
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,868
Anything?

455
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:09,277
We found what might be a hole
where he said he fired into the street,

456
00:32:09,316 --> 00:32:13,484
but no nail even after sweeping
the block with metal detectors.

457
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,934
Probably took a ride
in some bastard's radio,

458
00:32:15,992 --> 00:32:17,962
but now it's in a tire pile somewhere.

459
00:32:18,214 --> 00:32:20,734
So our next move is a search
and seizure on that truck.

460
00:32:20,812 --> 00:32:24,528
Along with a court order for hair
and blood from Chris and Snoop both.

461
00:32:24,935 --> 00:32:27,368
With everything we're pulling out
of these houses,

462
00:32:27,504 --> 00:32:29,275
we might get lucky
with some trace work.

463
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,594
What's your P.C.?

464
00:32:30,943 --> 00:32:32,280
Herc sees the nail gun.

465
00:32:32,668 --> 00:32:34,260
Nothing wrong with owning a power tool.

466
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:36,755
What's the P.C.
on Chris and Snoop specifically?

467
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:38,034
A witness.

468
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:42,714
Boy who was told by
a co-conspirator who the murderer was.

469
00:32:43,076 --> 00:32:46,139
The boy is a source.
He's not a witness.

470
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,350
If he's just a source,
you don't have enough.

471
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:51,156
With the links that we got between
some of these bodies of Stanfield

472
00:32:51,194 --> 00:32:53,036
and his organization,
we have a pattern.

473
00:32:53,152 --> 00:32:56,169
Weak.
Very weak.

474
00:32:56,447 --> 00:32:57,533
Oh, fuck it.

475
00:32:59,506 --> 00:33:00,664
Give me an hour.

476
00:33:05,645 --> 00:33:07,348
<i>You haven't let me alone all week.</i>

477
00:33:07,464 --> 00:33:10,848
<i>Every time I come out of the pool,</i>
<i>want to dry me off without a towel.</i>

478
00:33:14,311 --> 00:33:16,288
- Dennis Wise.
- Hey, man.

479
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:19,456
Yeah.
Were you able to get some word?

480
00:33:20,627 --> 00:33:23,481
On my say so,
he's willing to sit and hear you out.

481
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,569
What you asking him for,
I don't know.

482
00:33:30,016 --> 00:33:31,101
He'll love it, though.

483
00:33:31,431 --> 00:33:35,813
You see my man Carver again,
you tell him he owe me one now.

484
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:39,032
All right, man.
Appreciate it.

485
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:40,254
You got it, bro.

486
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:45,487
Y'all coming back with a warrant?

487
00:33:46,922 --> 00:33:48,744
The roughneck in room 232.

488
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,888
From what I know,
he runs a gym program for kids.

489
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:57,009
He got hisself shot for trying
to pull a kid off the corner.

490
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,220
Look, you need to speak up now

491
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:04,927
or face the fact
that you never spoke at all.

492
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:09,739
They wouldn't let me see my son,
at marches.

493
00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:14,133
Said there wasn't much left
by the time y'all found him.

494
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:19,665
We did the best we could
with the information we had.

495
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:31,096
Word come to me
that a man named Chris

496
00:34:31,747 --> 00:34:36,691
ad a girl named loop or Snoop
or some such took my son and killed him.

497
00:34:37,944 --> 00:34:40,057
Told I would never see my boy again.

498
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:47,916
Why can't you just make
an exception in this case

499
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:49,777
and move his name
to the top of the list?

500
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:51,465
See that he gets another foster parent.

501
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,023
The list is the list.

502
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:55,252
Some clients have been
in group homes for years.

503
00:34:55,446 --> 00:34:56,932
He was in group homes for years.

504
00:34:57,165 --> 00:34:59,878
- Now he's gotta go back because--
- Please don't raise your voice.

505
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:02,107
- If you're going to raise your voice--
- Please.

506
00:35:04,945 --> 00:35:07,698
There's gotta be se way
that he doesn't have to go--

507
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,150
Yeah, there is.

508
00:35:15,192 --> 00:35:16,259
There's gotta be.

509
00:35:19,373 --> 00:35:20,458
How about--

510
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:25,744
How about if I take him
as a foster parent?

511
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:28,458
The screening process takes 3-4 months.

512
00:35:28,652 --> 00:35:30,670
This child can't be
in your custody, sergeant.

513
00:35:30,748 --> 00:35:34,218
He needs to come back under
our supervision per the juvenile order.

514
00:35:43,882 --> 00:35:46,421
Think you all that
for hassling niggers and shit.

515
00:35:46,776 --> 00:35:50,226
I know I'm all that.
I'm thinking about some pussy.

516
00:35:50,478 --> 00:35:51,553
Yeah. Me, too.

517
00:35:52,823 --> 00:35:54,064
They dumped their tools.

518
00:35:57,379 --> 00:36:00,793
Nothing under the seats.
Nothing in the glove box.

519
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:05,156
Registered to some
little old lady, no doubt.

520
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:07,101
These guys know the drill.

521
00:36:09,262 --> 00:36:11,278
Can you see these two riding tail?

522
00:36:14,991 --> 00:36:16,115
Come on.

523
00:36:41,194 --> 00:36:43,036
Aw, shit.

524
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:47,824
There it is.

525
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:55,914
It ain't even our truck.

526
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:05,503
But I need to hear it from you.

527
00:37:06,055 --> 00:37:07,121
From me?

528
00:37:08,404 --> 00:37:10,148
This is not my affair, huh?

529
00:37:11,115 --> 00:37:13,616
It is what Joe Sats said.
I'm only here right now for Joe.

530
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,869
It's who I trust,
who I respect,

531
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,481
Who I worked with for many years.

532
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,400
You I do not know,
and I don't need to know.

533
00:37:22,497 --> 00:37:27,170
But because this thing
go wrong for Joe, then--

534
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:30,426
Well, how am I supposed to know
this ain't no setup?

535
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:34,986
How I supposed to know
your people ain't in on it, too?

536
00:37:36,556 --> 00:37:40,996
You know because Joe says
and because I say.

537
00:37:42,422 --> 00:37:44,218
And you trust your people like that?

538
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:49,672
I talk to my driver.
I looked into his soul.

539
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,635
Chris and Snoop just been found,

540
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:20,756
with a gun charge found in the truck.

541
00:38:22,056 --> 00:38:23,378
Call the bondsman.

542
00:38:24,173 --> 00:38:27,228
But first,
put a follow on him right there.

543
00:38:29,055 --> 00:38:30,744
Who, white dude with the hat on?

544
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:32,720
- What, he a problem?
- Naw.

545
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:36,953
I just need to know more.

546
00:38:38,911 --> 00:38:40,055
All right.

547
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:45,259
Satisfied?

548
00:38:45,434 --> 00:38:46,927
90,000 to you in the morning.

549
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:48,652
We'll put a hundred more on later

550
00:38:48,865 --> 00:38:51,201
After the heat on them
empty houses gives way.

551
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:02,337
What the fuck are you doing here?

552
00:39:03,782 --> 00:39:05,178
You think that charge gets dropped

553
00:39:05,236 --> 00:39:07,358
without somebody
showing you some special love?

554
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:12,146
You hungry?

555
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:14,891
Come on.

556
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:26,885
All right.

557
00:39:26,943 --> 00:39:29,754
Might be surety bond
on this Chris Partlow

558
00:39:30,173 --> 00:39:31,457
given all of his priors.

559
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:34,315
Pearson woman--
Not so much.

560
00:39:34,646 --> 00:39:35,648
All right?

561
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:50,750
What's this?

562
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:52,243
Court order.

563
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,619
We get blood and hair.

564
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,047
14 head hairs, 14 body hairs
two blood samples each.

565
00:39:59,473 --> 00:40:00,714
It's a lot of houses.

566
00:40:01,437 --> 00:40:02,562
A lot of deeds.

567
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,809
Who knows what you left behind?

568
00:40:16,493 --> 00:40:17,715
We still in the city?

569
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:20,975
Cylburn arboretum.

570
00:40:21,673 --> 00:40:23,197
Pumlico is right up the hill.

571
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,639
This is nice.

572
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,160
I ain't no snitch.

573
00:40:36,164 --> 00:40:37,424
I didn't say you were.

574
00:40:37,998 --> 00:40:39,588
I been doing this a long time.

575
00:40:40,926 --> 00:40:42,982
I ain't never said nothing to no cop.

576
00:40:52,763 --> 00:40:53,965
I feel old.

577
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,891
I been out there since I was 13.

578
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:01,806
I ain't never fucked up a count,
never stole off a package,

579
00:41:02,152 --> 00:41:04,905
never did some shit
that I wasn't told to do.

580
00:41:05,834 --> 00:41:07,017
I've been straight up.

581
00:41:07,075 --> 00:41:08,258
But what come back?

582
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,494
You think if I get jammed up
on some shit,

583
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:12,802
they'd be like, "all right.
Yeah. Bodie been there.

584
00:41:12,841 --> 00:41:14,702
"Bodie hang tough.
We got to his pay lawyer.

585
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:15,904
We got a bail."

586
00:41:17,011 --> 00:41:18,833
They want me to stand
with them, right?

587
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:21,450
Where the fuck they at when
they supposed to be standing by us?

588
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:24,205
I mean, when shit goes bad
and there's hell to pay,

589
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:25,989
where they at?

590
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:29,646
This game is rigged, man.

591
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,545
Be like the little bitches
on a chessboard.

592
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:35,204
Pawns.

593
00:41:38,423 --> 00:41:40,671
Yo, I'm not snitching
on none of my boys,

594
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:45,288
not my corner, and not no Barksdale
people or what's left of them.

595
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:48,728
But Marlo--
this nigger and his kind, man--

596
00:41:49,154 --> 00:41:50,685
They gotta fall.
They gotta.

597
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:55,734
Well, for that to happen,
somebody's gotta step up.

598
00:42:00,457 --> 00:42:01,659
I'll do what I gotta.

599
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:03,268
I don't give a fuck.

600
00:42:05,163 --> 00:42:07,683
Just don't ask me to live
on my fucking knees, you know.

601
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:14,699
You're a soldier, Bodie.

602
00:42:17,607 --> 00:42:18,770
Hell, yeah.

603
00:42:37,794 --> 00:42:38,996
I remember you.

604
00:42:39,548 --> 00:42:41,739
You used to be
a role-up pitcher and Fremont.

605
00:42:41,797 --> 00:42:43,406
Yeah. It was my old post.

606
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:46,764
- I came up with C.B.S.
- Calhoun-Baker-Stricker.

607
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,825
Yeah. I used to have
to bang up on y'all all the time.

608
00:42:50,883 --> 00:42:52,202
I remember that, too.

609
00:42:54,317 --> 00:42:57,128
Yeah.
I ain't a cop now, right.

610
00:42:58,183 --> 00:43:02,448
And like I told Cutty,
I'm sort of like a teacher now,

611
00:43:02,894 --> 00:43:04,548
And that's how I come to know Naman.

612
00:43:04,704 --> 00:43:06,972
Only reason I'm even here
is Cutty spoke for you.

613
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,594
He say what I'm asking?

614
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,465
Your boy...

615
00:43:14,202 --> 00:43:18,227
is smart and funny,
and open-hearted,

616
00:43:19,275 --> 00:43:20,787
and he got some flex in him.

617
00:43:21,882 --> 00:43:24,552
And I ain't see it at first
'cause he was always acting out,

618
00:43:24,726 --> 00:43:27,111
always full up of corner talk.

619
00:43:27,226 --> 00:43:29,494
You know,
just talking shit to hide hisself.

620
00:43:30,737 --> 00:43:33,789
But he could go a lot of places,
and do a lot of things in his life,

621
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:36,112
be out there in the world in a way that,

622
00:43:36,189 --> 00:43:38,031
you know,
didn't happen for you and me.

623
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,341
I mean, you know, our kind?
Shit.

624
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,211
Man, we both know we gonna go
to our grave forever knowing

625
00:43:47,643 --> 00:43:50,724
what block Bentalou dead-ends at or

626
00:43:50,899 --> 00:43:53,234
who got their liquor license
over at the underground

627
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:54,860
or what corner Tatum man got shot

628
00:43:54,918 --> 00:43:57,388
on when he come out
the musical lounge back in '88.

629
00:43:57,804 --> 00:43:59,335
It's a vision in Gold.

630
00:44:06,933 --> 00:44:08,445
I mean, the westside, we know...

631
00:44:10,187 --> 00:44:11,486
it's dead, man.

632
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:14,543
You know, people in the game nowadays--

633
00:44:15,842 --> 00:44:17,763
I mean, it's a whole different breed.

634
00:44:18,244 --> 00:44:20,067
No code, no family,

635
00:44:21,863 --> 00:44:23,298
and damn sure no respect.

636
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:27,714
I mean, you send Naman
out on the corner now,

637
00:44:28,404 --> 00:44:33,219
giving him maybe one, two years
before you down at the morgue

638
00:44:34,092 --> 00:44:37,077
and maybe if you're lucky
up here with you.

639
00:44:38,085 --> 00:44:39,287
Maybe, maybe not.

640
00:44:39,365 --> 00:44:40,567
That's the game.

641
00:44:40,663 --> 00:44:42,987
I'm talking about Naman here, Mr. Brice.

642
00:44:45,273 --> 00:44:48,220
He's a lot of things,
a lot of good things.

643
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,333
I mean, before you know,
he might surprise all of us

644
00:44:51,372 --> 00:44:54,758
given half a chance,
but he ain't made for them corners, man.

645
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,253
I mean, not like we were.

646
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:02,558
That's why I come down here--
because I gotta believe that you see it.

647
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:06,191
Being who you are
and all you've been through.

648
00:45:10,205 --> 00:45:11,388
You know your son.

649
00:45:18,296 --> 00:45:19,673
It's in your hands, man.

650
00:45:24,403 --> 00:45:25,832
You asking too much.

651
00:45:26,414 --> 00:45:28,759
Yeah. I'm asking.

652
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:34,164
You sure it was the boy Bodie?

653
00:45:34,256 --> 00:45:36,252
Man, I seen him
come from out of central bookings

654
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:37,667
over on Eager street side.

655
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:40,034
Then he got in some car
with some white dude.

656
00:45:40,092 --> 00:45:42,108
Police?
What kind of car, a caprice?

657
00:45:43,494 --> 00:45:44,792
No. O.T., I think.

658
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,655
They on you like a motherfucker.

659
00:45:52,193 --> 00:45:55,551
They jacking you up, pulling all
your work out of them houses, right?

660
00:45:57,411 --> 00:45:59,473
Man, we can't have nobody
snitching on us now.

661
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:01,265
We ain't sure it's that.

662
00:46:01,941 --> 00:46:03,422
What, you want to let it go?

663
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:05,383
Risk it?

664
00:46:07,435 --> 00:46:08,633
Send a message.

665
00:46:09,226 --> 00:46:11,426
Maybe give it to your pup,
get him started.

666
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:15,230
You and Snoop, y'all lay low
till this shit here blow down.

667
00:46:16,013 --> 00:46:17,328
Boy worked for Bodie.

668
00:46:17,533 --> 00:46:19,556
First time,
must be someone he didn't know.

669
00:46:26,646 --> 00:46:27,981
You hear what Joe said?

670
00:46:28,246 --> 00:46:30,740
Joe's saying this cocksucker
who stole our shit

671
00:46:31,391 --> 00:46:34,359
wants to sell it back to us
for 30 on the dollar.

672
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,940
Joe's saying it's another 90
to buy back our shit.

673
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,516
Dang, yo.

674
00:46:51,223 --> 00:46:52,676
Thought you forgot about me.

675
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:56,125
Hey, why don't you wait outside?

676
00:47:02,442 --> 00:47:03,876
You spoke to his father?

677
00:47:06,602 --> 00:47:07,931
If it goes the way I think,

678
00:47:08,401 --> 00:47:10,542
he'll be back
with his mom by tomorrow.

679
00:47:11,732 --> 00:47:13,205
Big day all around tomorrow.

680
00:47:13,342 --> 00:47:16,401
Delegate Watkins got us 30
minutes at the Mayor's office.

681
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:24,919
Yo, spider, what's the count?

682
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:27,788
I don't even think
we gonna sell out today, man.

683
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:37,937
Yo, Bodie.

684
00:47:39,312 --> 00:47:40,392
Yo, bode.

685
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,898
Yo, Bodie, you better run, yo.

686
00:47:54,781 --> 00:47:56,670
Yo, this my corner.
I ain't running nowhere.

687
00:47:56,737 --> 00:47:57,895
Bodie, is you crazy?

688
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,439
Shit is on!

689
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,384
Run with it, motherfuckers!

690
00:48:12,577 --> 00:48:13,736
I don't give a fuck!

691
00:48:15,388 --> 00:48:16,664
I'm right here!

692
00:48:17,815 --> 00:48:20,447
You ain't putting me up in one
of them empty-ass houses, neither.

693
00:48:23,264 --> 00:48:24,285
Come on, man.

694
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:00,417
I don't know about this.

695
00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:02,491
Mayor's office.

696
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:08,549
Yes. Actually, you want the department
of housing and community development.

697
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:11,437
Look, I don't know about this, man.
I just...

698
00:50:14,785 --> 00:50:15,786
ma'am, uh--

699
00:50:19,479 --> 00:50:20,520
If...

700
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:22,837
I'm sorry.

701
00:50:23,516 --> 00:50:25,696
If the mayor prefers not to--

702
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:28,646
or if he, like, feels more comfortable
with Dr. Perenni alone,

703
00:50:29,608 --> 00:50:32,937
you know, because of the
drug-legalization controversy last year.

704
00:50:33,293 --> 00:50:35,709
I don't ink mayor Carcetti
is in your meeting.

705
00:50:35,826 --> 00:50:37,123
He's in Annapolis.

706
00:50:40,279 --> 00:50:42,970
OK. Thank you.

707
00:50:51,571 --> 00:50:52,671
What up?

708
00:50:55,794 --> 00:50:56,932
Still asleep?

709
00:50:58,347 --> 00:50:59,800
Early bird get that worm.

710
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:04,088
How you liking the crib?

711
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:06,347
Fine. Thanks.

712
00:51:07,419 --> 00:51:09,226
Must feel good to be on your own.

713
00:51:13,076 --> 00:51:14,733
Yo, where you get that rent from?

714
00:51:18,086 --> 00:51:19,283
Took it from a nigger.

715
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:26,063
Why? You want it?

716
00:51:26,476 --> 00:51:28,031
No. No. You keep it, shorty.

717
00:51:34,584 --> 00:51:36,372
I'll go get Bug ready for school.

718
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,318
You ready to put in work?

719
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:43,760
Two things, then.

720
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:47,590
First, we' gonna give you
the corner up on Passno,

721
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:50,130
used to be Bodie's old corner.

722
00:51:50,503 --> 00:51:51,557
Now it's yours.

723
00:51:53,203 --> 00:51:54,794
Crew that up. Run that shit.

724
00:51:55,814 --> 00:51:57,699
You get the points on that shop.

725
00:52:00,095 --> 00:52:01,667
Then we got this other thing.

726
00:52:05,161 --> 00:52:09,452
Yo, if I ain't stepping on nothing,
who was that who dropped for you, yo?

727
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:15,730
Bug's daddy.

728
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:16,967
Word?

729
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,117
That's not how you spell
"paraphernalia."

730
00:52:38,184 --> 00:52:40,353
- How the fuck do you spell it?
- Hey, fellows.

731
00:52:40,467 --> 00:52:42,529
- Not like that.
- McNulty. Hey.

732
00:52:43,724 --> 00:52:45,118
You're here 4:00-12:00, right?

733
00:52:45,152 --> 00:52:46,841
- You heard about Bodie?
- What about?

734
00:52:46,919 --> 00:52:48,844
- Bodie from up Passno.
- Yeah, yeah. What?

735
00:52:49,104 --> 00:52:50,478
Shot dead on his corner.

736
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:52,830
Midnight shift caught it.

737
00:52:53,505 --> 00:52:54,703
Check the read-out.

738
00:52:54,782 --> 00:52:56,431
Sergeant, get your ass in here.

739
00:53:00,074 --> 00:53:03,472
Goddamn it, Norton,
you're on the brink of insubordination.

740
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,919
You call D.S.S. Right now
and ship him out.

741
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:18,691
- That's an order.
- Lieutenant.

742
00:53:24,048 --> 00:53:26,620
I got $235 if it helps.

743
00:53:28,683 --> 00:53:29,802
How would that help?

744
00:53:30,963 --> 00:53:32,750
Maybe we can get
a foster spot like that.

745
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:33,928
Pay somebody.

746
00:53:45,022 --> 00:53:46,927
This is tracking, plain and simple.

747
00:53:47,411 --> 00:53:49,355
It's a socialization process.

748
00:53:49,551 --> 00:53:52,026
To any parent who complains,
you're still segregating them.

749
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:54,010
Look, it's for their benefit,

750
00:53:54,088 --> 00:53:56,591
and for the benefit
of the teachers trying to teach.

751
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,557
And you're proposing to expand
this to every middle school?

752
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,574
With enough grant money
and your support, yes.

753
00:54:03,315 --> 00:54:04,493
By September--

754
00:54:04,632 --> 00:54:06,667
But you wouldn't be teaching
test curriculum here?

755
00:54:06,706 --> 00:54:09,790
These would be the children
left behind, so to speak.

756
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,658
Yeah, but as it, I mean,

757
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:13,964
We're leaving them all
behind anyway.

758
00:54:14,082 --> 00:54:15,613
We just don't want to admit it.

759
00:54:19,195 --> 00:54:23,202
- What we mean to say is--
- Gentlemen, we'll be in touch.

760
00:54:32,751 --> 00:54:33,968
So, what, that's it?

761
00:54:34,008 --> 00:54:36,227
After a two minute hearing,
they stick a fork in us?

762
00:54:37,013 --> 00:54:38,623
I'm a liability in there, man.

763
00:54:40,454 --> 00:54:42,787
Seems like every time
I open my mouth in this town,

764
00:54:42,827 --> 00:54:44,857
I'm telling people things
they don't want to know.

765
00:54:44,877 --> 00:54:46,130
It's not you. It's the process.

766
00:54:46,169 --> 00:54:47,878
- The process?
- When we get the grant,

767
00:54:48,212 --> 00:54:50,117
We study the problem,
we propose solutions.

768
00:54:50,384 --> 00:54:51,645
If they listen, they listen.

769
00:54:51,712 --> 00:54:54,203
If they don't,
it still makes for great research.

770
00:54:54,558 --> 00:54:56,895
What we publish on this is
gonna get a lot of attention.

771
00:54:56,959 --> 00:54:59,723
- From who?
- From other researchers, academics.

772
00:55:00,158 --> 00:55:03,575
Academics?
What they gonna study your study.

773
00:55:09,742 --> 00:55:11,078
When do this shit change?

774
00:55:13,892 --> 00:55:15,149
And you put him out, huh?

775
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:17,506
He need to get hard.

776
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:20,271
Well, if he out, then he out.

777
00:55:21,995 --> 00:55:23,174
Oh, no, you not.

778
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:25,403
You ain't gonna take my son
away from me.

779
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,068
Remember who the fuck
you talking to right here.

780
00:55:28,697 --> 00:55:29,993
Remember who I am.

781
00:55:31,376 --> 00:55:33,143
My word is still my word.

782
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:35,720
In here, in Baltimore,

783
00:55:35,867 --> 00:55:38,479
in any place
you can think of calling home,

784
00:55:39,108 --> 00:55:41,002
it'll be my word.
They'll find you.

785
00:55:43,232 --> 00:55:46,747
Man come down here to say my son
can be anything he damn please.

786
00:55:47,354 --> 00:55:48,650
Except a soldier.

787
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,446
Yeah.
Well, look at me up in here.

788
00:55:54,381 --> 00:55:57,798
Who the fuck would want to be that
if they could be anything else, Dalonda?

789
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,522
So, did you cut me off, too?

790
00:56:10,778 --> 00:56:13,449
You still got me.
We'll get by.

791
00:56:15,822 --> 00:56:17,590
But you gonna let go of that boy.

792
00:56:18,862 --> 00:56:20,080
Bet that.

793
00:56:27,753 --> 00:56:28,845
Quien es?

794
00:56:29,361 --> 00:56:30,618
Tu amor, baby.

795
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:03,055
For your bank?

796
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:05,688
That's for your pain, Butch.

797
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:07,537
I be my own bank now.

798
00:57:09,303 --> 00:57:10,609
They ain't follow you?

799
00:57:10,825 --> 00:57:12,318
Naw. Joe paid him my way.

800
00:57:12,586 --> 00:57:15,545
He had to admit my word was
better than his. You feel me?

801
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:18,849
Let's go, then.

802
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:34,238
He is in the van, in the garage
in the back of 2249 Polk street.

803
00:57:34,793 --> 00:57:36,462
Key gonna be in the cinderblock.

804
00:57:52,822 --> 00:57:54,432
You stole this much,

805
00:57:55,345 --> 00:57:56,759
and is ain't over.

806
00:58:00,206 --> 00:58:01,247
This ain't over.

807
00:58:31,955 --> 00:58:34,225
Thing about that republican ass--

808
00:58:34,292 --> 00:58:37,764
It's not the flesh of
his political fathers.

809
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:04,378
- Jesus. You left it
on the table.

810
00:59:04,444 --> 00:59:06,580
Smug son of a bitch.

811
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:09,052
He was gonna make beg

812
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,355
Then call a press conference

813
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:14,660
So the world could
see me on my knees.

814
00:59:14,727 --> 00:59:17,132
Don't worry.

815
00:59:17,198 --> 00:59:20,872
Two years,
and we'll make him pay.

816
00:59:24,077 --> 00:59:25,379
Icicle.

817
00:59:25,447 --> 00:59:26,748
Got those icicles.

818
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:32,492
Shake down.

819
00:59:36,131 --> 00:59:38,168
Corner's indicted.

820
00:59:38,234 --> 00:59:39,703
Go on. Get.

821
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:41,407
Except you, motherfucker.

822
00:59:41,474 --> 00:59:42,476
On the wall.

823
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:49,053
Sorry about Bodie.

824
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,556
I ain't jacking you up.

825
00:59:50,622 --> 00:59:52,426
I'm trying to do right
for your boy.

826
00:59:52,493 --> 00:59:55,163
Who dropped him?
- Y'all did.

827
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:59,104
They took him out 'cause
he was talking to y'all.

828
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:02,477
Word is they seen him with the
police down at central booking.

829
01:00:02,543 --> 01:00:07,251
So cuff me or kick my ass off this
corner before you do me the same.

830
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:22,944
Hey, Duquon.

831
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:26,985
Don't you need
to be at Douglas?

832
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:29,523
I'm on my way there. Yeah.

833
01:00:29,589 --> 01:00:32,026
Where's your book bag?

834
01:00:32,093 --> 01:00:35,232
- Oh, it's-- I'm gonna stop
past the house and get it.

835
01:00:40,274 --> 01:00:43,145
It's a present
for all you did.

836
01:00:47,386 --> 01:00:49,256
It's for your desk.

837
01:00:49,323 --> 01:00:55,200
- That's great, Duquon.
Thanks.

838
01:00:55,266 --> 01:00:58,205
Stop past anytime.

839
01:00:58,271 --> 01:01:01,910
Let me know how it's
going with you.

840
01:01:01,977 --> 01:01:03,179
OK.

841
01:01:12,195 --> 01:01:15,400
- But I ain't want to go back.
- Program's ending, Zanovia.

842
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:18,906
- Yeah, boy.
Back to gen. Pop.

843
01:01:18,973 --> 01:01:21,678
- Yes.
Pack my bags.

844
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:22,879
Shut up.

845
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:24,950
What about you?

846
01:01:25,017 --> 01:01:31,227
I mean, this was all right.

847
01:01:31,294 --> 01:01:33,298
But maybe it's time.

848
01:01:39,842 --> 01:01:42,179
Why are you up?

849
01:01:42,246 --> 01:01:44,216
You're working 4:00-12:00.

850
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:47,956
What's the matter?

851
01:01:48,023 --> 01:01:49,593
Something with these bodies.

852
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:53,966
Lester and them are
getting up on it.

853
01:01:54,033 --> 01:01:57,539
It's under Daniels.

854
01:01:57,606 --> 01:02:00,511
He's got suction there.

855
01:02:00,577 --> 01:02:02,180
He can deliver.

856
01:02:02,247 --> 01:02:04,651
You want in.

857
01:02:04,718 --> 01:02:07,556
- I just feel like
I owe it now.

858
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,459
To who?

859
01:02:09,527 --> 01:02:11,195
To this kid.

860
01:02:11,263 --> 01:02:13,634
Corner kid.

861
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:15,937
Getting ready to turn him,
you know.

862
01:02:16,037 --> 01:02:19,876
Wrap him up and give him
to Lester as a present.

863
01:02:19,943 --> 01:02:21,480
- He one of the bodies
in the houses?

864
01:02:21,547 --> 01:02:27,123
- No. They dropped him
in the street.

865
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:29,293
Maybe I'd be different,
you know.

866
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,832
Different?

867
01:02:31,897 --> 01:02:33,467
Yeah.

868
01:02:33,534 --> 01:02:38,074
No more of the drinking and warring
and all that, all that anger.

869
01:02:42,783 --> 01:02:45,053
'Cause I'm better now
here with you.

870
01:02:50,963 --> 01:02:54,236
No more "Jimmy busts
balls world."

871
01:02:54,302 --> 01:02:57,709
Jimmy bust balls?

872
01:02:57,776 --> 01:03:00,514
- I swear to God being that
son of a bitch nearly killed him.

873
01:03:24,621 --> 01:03:26,624
It's OK.

874
01:03:26,691 --> 01:03:28,561
What?

875
01:03:28,628 --> 01:03:30,330
You tried.

876
01:03:30,398 --> 01:03:34,971
You don't need to feel bad.

877
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,675
Thanks.

878
01:03:51,467 --> 01:03:53,905
Hey, yo, look at this.

879
01:03:53,972 --> 01:03:55,908
Got to fucking
talk to you.

880
01:03:55,975 --> 01:03:57,744
- All right, Randy,
this way.

881
01:04:35,609 --> 01:04:37,980
Take that top Bunk over there.

882
01:05:37,915 --> 01:05:40,352
Are you sure?

883
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,527
I'm not asking
'cause I can't use you.

884
01:05:44,593 --> 01:05:45,996
I'm asking for your sake.

885
01:05:46,063 --> 01:05:47,632
I think I can do this

886
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:50,003
And keep myself away
from myself,

887
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:52,707
If that makes any sense.

888
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:05,428
But I gotta tell you.

889
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:08,201
We're not gonna get Marlo Stanfield
or anyone else above the street

890
01:06:08,266 --> 01:06:10,905
Not on street corners.
- What do you suggest?

891
01:06:10,972 --> 01:06:13,442
Either a wide C.I.
or a title iii.

892
01:06:13,509 --> 01:06:15,913
That's what makes this case.

893
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,716
You sure?

894
01:06:17,783 --> 01:06:21,890
Maybe you do this fast
and clean and simple.

895
01:06:21,957 --> 01:06:25,096
Then you don't do it at all.

896
01:06:25,163 --> 01:06:27,500
Chain of command, colonel.

897
01:06:29,369 --> 01:06:33,309
- How in the hell do we kick up
percentages in math and reading both?

898
01:06:33,376 --> 01:06:35,547
You believe the numbers?

899
01:06:35,614 --> 01:06:40,790
- 38% proficient.
8% advanced. What?

900
01:06:40,856 --> 01:06:44,662
- Proficient means they're at
least two grades below their level.

901
01:06:44,729 --> 01:06:48,903
Advanced can mean they're at
grade level or a year below.

902
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:53,343
They score them like that, and
they say we're making progress.

903
01:06:55,414 --> 01:06:57,285
OK. I'm still learning.

904
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,755
Naw. You're gonna be fine.

905
01:06:59,822 --> 01:07:03,695
- Albert, Zanovia, Naman,
good to have you back with us.

906
01:07:03,762 --> 01:07:06,934
- Yeah. Your worst nightmare
come right back on you.

907
01:07:12,109 --> 01:07:13,846
Say, naw, I'm just foolin'.

908
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:19,088
OK. Everyone open to 121.

909
01:07:23,929 --> 01:07:26,901
Who figured out
the first problem?

910
01:07:26,968 --> 01:07:28,036
Kareem?

911
01:07:28,103 --> 01:07:29,205
164.

912
01:07:29,272 --> 01:07:30,975
- Correct.
How'd you get it?

913
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:32,177
Don't know.

914
01:07:32,244 --> 01:07:35,082
Come. Show us.

915
01:07:35,148 --> 01:07:37,953
- Just when you think
you're done.

916
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,358
What's that one? 20?

917
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:43,263
22.

918
01:07:43,329 --> 01:07:45,633
Anybody heard from Bunk?

919
01:07:45,699 --> 01:07:49,573
- Ballistics say the guns match
to nothing. Open and closed.

920
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,343
And they cleaned the prints.

921
01:07:51,409 --> 01:07:55,217
- Well, maybe
we'll find a witness.

922
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:59,324
Maybe trace lab will give us
a hair or splatter or something.

923
01:07:59,391 --> 01:08:02,061
But short of that, we're gonna
have to go pro-Active.

924
01:08:02,128 --> 01:08:05,834
- Where are you on the new body?
- Back to square one.

925
01:08:05,901 --> 01:08:07,971
We're in here for the long haul.

926
01:08:08,038 --> 01:08:10,842
Colonel, how you happen to pick
this place for us to stage?

927
01:08:10,909 --> 01:08:12,913
- Lemille?
- Hmm.

928
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:16,719
- hey closed it a few years back, and I
knew it was near a lot of our crime scenes.

929
01:08:16,786 --> 01:08:21,695
I went to school here
back in the day.

930
01:08:21,761 --> 01:08:24,399
Got a decent education
now that I think on it.

931
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:52,080
You try and talk to him?

932
01:08:52,147 --> 01:08:55,285
Didn't know what to say.

933
01:08:55,352 --> 01:08:57,923
Only heard from my sergeant
this morning.

934
01:08:57,990 --> 01:09:00,627
Guess I missed the 24
they wrote on it.

935
01:09:00,694 --> 01:09:02,398
- And he really tried
to do himself?

936
01:09:02,464 --> 01:09:04,534
It wasn't just for show
or nothing?

937
01:09:04,601 --> 01:09:08,875
- He's got some problems, but
insincerity ain't one of them.

938
01:09:08,941 --> 01:09:11,112
- Shame's some
tricky shit, ain't it?

939
01:09:11,179 --> 01:09:12,782
Makes you feel like
you want to change

940
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:15,887
And then beats you back down
when think you can't.

941
01:09:15,953 --> 01:09:18,124
- When was the last time
y'all talked?

942
01:09:18,191 --> 01:09:19,794
More than a couple of years

943
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:22,499
Since he last got
on the wagon, I think.

944
01:09:22,565 --> 01:09:25,103
But if he's up in d ward,

945
01:09:25,170 --> 01:09:27,474
He's clearing the motherfucker
right now.

946
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:04,437
You coming?

947
01:10:04,504 --> 01:10:06,608
Maybe later.

948
01:10:53,554 --> 01:10:56,693
- Can't believe you'd leave
that money on the table.

949
01:10:56,758 --> 01:10:59,864
Why not?

950
01:10:59,931 --> 01:11:02,936
School. Kids.

951
01:11:03,003 --> 01:11:04,405
Shit.

952
01:11:04,473 --> 01:11:07,010
You ain't done enough
of this here, I suppose.

953
01:11:07,077 --> 01:11:09,648
They always disappoint.

954
01:11:09,716 --> 01:11:13,955
Closer you get, more you look.

955
01:11:14,022 --> 01:11:16,593
All of them.

956
01:11:20,467 --> 01:11:23,405
- If he tries...
might stay with Royce.

957
01:11:24,474 --> 01:11:27,479
If not, there's this young buck
out in Salisbury

958
01:11:27,545 --> 01:11:32,487
Thinks he can snatch up
the first district seat.

959
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:14,459
- You can look him
in the eye now.

960
01:12:14,525 --> 01:12:17,163
No matter who he is
or what he's done,

961
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,066
You look him right in the eye.

962
01:12:34,526 --> 01:12:37,364
I'm still your father.

963
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,336
What you want?

964
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:38,200
