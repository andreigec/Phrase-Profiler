1
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,864
That's far enough.

2
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,273
Drop your laundry
and turn slowly.

3
00:01:58,736 --> 00:02:00,644
So, you gonna
rob me now?

4
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,564
I need to remind you
who I am?

5
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,800
Omar, isn't it?

6
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:10,707
Pull it slowly.

7
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,933
Then toss it.

8
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:14,143
Oh, I will move slow.

9
00:02:14,497 --> 00:02:16,228
But I ain't tossin' nothin'

10
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:18,174
bow tie.

11
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:19,490
So whatever you gonna do

12
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:21,575
you might as well go ahead
and make it quick.

13
00:02:22,886 --> 00:02:24,251
I knew you'd come back.

14
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:26,071
I trust you didn't
lose sleep over it.

15
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:28,081
Worryin' about you would
be like wonderin'

16
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:29,396
if the sun's gonna come up.

17
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:32,641
I ain't about to wild out over it.

18
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,280
What I want to know is
how you find me?

19
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:38,124
Your boy, he didn't
give you up easy.

20
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,536
Ain't sugar-water runnin'
through them veins.

21
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:43,404
- You kill him?
- He's resting.

22
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:46,309
I see you favor a 45.

23
00:02:46,436 --> 00:02:47,965
Tonight I do.

24
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:51,691
And I keeps one in the chamber,
in case you ponderin'.

25
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:55,933
Nice show piece
you got there.

26
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:59,761
Walther PPK.
380, double action.

27
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:02,085
Hear them walthers
like to jump some.

28
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:04,574
As will you,
with one in your elbow.

29
00:03:04,712 --> 00:03:07,618
That gun ain't got enough firepower
to make my joint useless.

30
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,132
It definitely won't stop me
from emptyin' out half my mag.

31
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:13,051
- You might not hit me.
- This range?

32
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,945
And this caliber?

33
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,460
Even if I miss,
I can't miss.

34
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:19,544
I admire a man
with confidence.

35
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,210
I don't see no sweat
your brow neither, bro.

36
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:30,262
I suppose we could
stand here all night.

37
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,651
S'pose we could.

38
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:35,494
Or settle this
once and forever.

39
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:43,869
I want to ask you something... brother.

40
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:51,160
Omar listenin'.

41
00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:25,395
Middle Ground

42
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:47,195
<i<I'm going up the west. </i>

43
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:49,549
<i>A-ight, me, too.
A- ight. </i>

44
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:52,802
Here we go.

45
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:01,100
<i>Yo, I need some
face time with the man. </i>

46
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,391
<i>Hold up, I'll holler
back at you, man. </i>

47
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:04,575
That would be Shamrock.

48
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,524
Assuming Stringer Bell is the man,
now we wait for the return call.

49
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:11,368
This is beautiful.

50
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:13,862
Lester, can you actually
believe we fucking sold

51
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:15,422
the wiretaps to the targets.

52
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:18,886
For a week at least.

53
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:21,950
Maybe we duck the bullet.

54
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:24,083
Maybe we clean this mess quietly,

55
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:26,894
throw some horseshit at
whatever reporter shows up

56
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:29,595
and the Mayor
forges and forgets.

57
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,411
We're ready to move on this, right?

58
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:34,072
As soon as we get the word,
we shut down all three zones

59
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:35,645
toss everyone into wagons.

60
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,983
There'll be nothing left
of it before midnight shift.

61
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:41,141
So what the fuck are we
waiting on for a day and half?

62
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:43,211
Why isn't the Hall calling us?

63
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:54,564
Commissioner Burrell
for Mayor Royce.

64
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,792
- I've heard enough...
- Hold on, Coleman.

65
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,260
Come on, let the man talk, huh?

66
00:06:58,402 --> 00:07:00,914
Excuse me, Mayor. I have
Commissioner Burrell on the line.

67
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:03,157
- He says it's urgent.
- I'll bet it is.

68
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:05,099
He wants to move, Clarence.

69
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:07,879
He wants to clean this shit up
yesterday, and so do we.

70
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,058
Tell him to hold.

71
00:07:09,743 --> 00:07:11,544
- Go ahead, gene.
- Look

72
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:13,586
I'm not a politician,
I'm an academic.

73
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,882
All I know is that from a
public health perspective

74
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,411
there are remarkable things
happening in the free zones.

75
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,390
Needle exchanges, on-site blood
testing, condom distribution.

76
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:26,049
Most of all we're interacting
with an at-risk community

77
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:27,465
that is largely elusive.

78
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,045
We're even talking some of these
people into drug treatment.

79
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:33,259
And that's just what U.M. and
Bon Secours have brought to the table.

80
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,887
If this thing were sanctioned

81
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,386
my department could put
public resources into play.

82
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,958
You people can't
see the forest here.

83
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:41,835
Odell?

84
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:46,527
When the story breaks, the ministers
will surely be against you.

85
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,391
And most of the City Council
will be walking sideways

86
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:51,202
away from your administration.

87
00:07:51,281 --> 00:07:53,935
And my guess is the Governor
and the legislature

88
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:57,789
will use this opportunity to piss on
the city from a great height.

89
00:07:57,884 --> 00:08:00,095
And Washington?
Oh...

90
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:01,984
Can you imagine how far

91
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:04,153
the United States
Department of Justice

92
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:06,192
is gonna crawl up
your ass behind this?

93
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,558
Crime is down, Odell.

94
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:12,763
Medical people are
telling me this could work.

95
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:16,602
I mean, a 14% decline
in felonies citywide

96
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,792
I might be untouchable on this.
Now, look, we need to think

97
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,836
see if we can keep
this thing going without

98
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:23,329
calling it what it really is, huh?

99
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:25,510
- Jesus.
- Now, there's got to be a way.

100
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,353
I want you to talk this thing out.
Hey, Erv, thanks for holding...

101
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,123
Yes, but...

102
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,235
Yes, I understand.

103
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:39,363
Then I'll wait
to hear from you.

104
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:43,564
We're to hold off
on any action in Amsterdam.

105
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:47,671
No arrests, no movement
until further notice.

106
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:50,293
He says he wants to regroup.

107
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:53,563
Determine the most
effective course of action.

108
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:57,575
Translate that for me, will ya, Erv?
I don't speak his fucked-up lingo.

109
00:08:57,685 --> 00:09:01,192
Royce is figuring a way to put
all of us in the guillotine

110
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,809
and keep the blood from
spraying anywhere near the Hall.

111
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:08,015
Shit, I'll be goddamned if
I'm gonna go out like that:

112
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:10,037
Bent over in public.

113
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,864
I can spin the story just as
well as that motherfucker.

114
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,802
- You're gonna go to the press?
- Not me.

115
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:17,550
But I know a slick little bastard

116
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:19,944
who will happily
put Hizzoner's shit in the street.

117
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:25,674
Somethin' funny 'bout that?

118
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,947
'Cause I look in the paper and I see
all these federal grants comin' down

119
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:30,084
but nothin' for B-and-B.

120
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:34,425
- You're expecting what?
- Payout.

121
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:36,439
A big payout for what
we put in, man.

122
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,754
Federal dollars on them
Howard Street rehabs.

123
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,519
- You gave money up front?
- 250,000, yep.

124
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:43,130
To Clay Davis.

125
00:09:44,598 --> 00:09:46,099
How you know?

126
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,105
What you sayin'?

127
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:50,696
He's runnin' game?
Naw, hell no, he ain't that brazen.

128
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,986
Lemme guess.

129
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,213
He told you about the faucet.

130
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:57,550
Or was it the goose
that laid the golden egg?

131
00:09:58,262 --> 00:09:59,968
You ever actually
meet the man?

132
00:10:00,094 --> 00:10:03,005
Did you ever actually see any of
your cash reach anyone in authority?

133
00:10:03,014 --> 00:10:04,883
Yeah, I met the guy
at the federal building.

134
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:05,573
Yeah, I met him.

135
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:06,521
Yeah, what office?

136
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:09,821
He came down to the lobby.

137
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:16,602
he rainmade you.

138
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:19,737
A guy says if you pay him,
he can make it rain.

139
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:23,013
You pay him. If and when it rains,
he takes the credit.

140
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:26,220
If and when it doesn't, he finds
reasons for you to pay him more.

141
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,689
Clay Davis rainmade you.

142
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,053
Naw, man, he got them building
permits in no time at all, man.

143
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:32,957
I mean, we bribing
these motherfuckers.

144
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:34,892
He got the city
contractor's money back.

145
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:37,024
- How much?
- 35,000 so far.

146
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:40,610
- On a quarter million you gave him?
- It's for bribing the motherfuckers.

147
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:41,778
There are no bribes!

148
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:44,874
You really think
a state senator is going

149
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:47,006
to risk his salary
and his position

150
00:10:47,164 --> 00:10:50,466
by walking into a federal office with
a briefcase full of drug money?

151
00:10:50,497 --> 00:10:52,376
I seen Chunky... Chunky Coates.

152
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:54,862
Chunky Coates gets his grant money
same way everyone does.

153
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:57,426
He fills out applications,
he makes sure the plans meet spec

154
00:10:57,454 --> 00:10:58,612
then he prays like hell.

155
00:11:00,132 --> 00:11:03,102
This is an old game in this
town, and Clay Davis?

156
00:11:04,187 --> 00:11:06,761
That goniff was born with
his hand in someone's pocket.

157
00:11:07,156 --> 00:11:09,352
I just wish you'd have
run it by me sooner.

158
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,351
Now here's Shamrock
returning Bodie's call.

159
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:27,419
<i>Talk about it. </i>

160
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,852
<i>Yo, the man said he'd see you,
same time as always. </i>

161
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:30,945
<i>You know the spot. </i>

162
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:34,260
During the first call, Sydnor had eyes
on Shamrock over in West Baltimore.

163
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,152
Alright? Now look at this.

164
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:40,314
At the time, Stringer Bell
was at the print shop.

165
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:42,099
So it couldn't be
a face-to-face meet.

166
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:44,563
We didn't catch a call between
Stringer and Shamrock.

167
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:46,284
How can that be?

168
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:49,775
Stringer's phone isn't on the same
network as everyone below him.

169
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,171
- Right you are, ma'am.
- Bell's not using Bernard's burners?

170
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:56,457
And Shamrock has a separate
phone for calling Bell.

171
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,405
We can't hear those calls because
the system's compartmentalized.

172
00:12:01,242 --> 00:12:02,759
Some tricky motherfuckers.

173
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:05,523
A week or so up on Bernard's phones
and we'll have everybody

174
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,761
up to and including Shamrock
tangled up in conspiracy counts.

175
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,435
But Bell or Barksdale?

176
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:13,209
Not unless we can pluck their
cell numbers out the air.

177
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,949
Where you headed?
Toy store.

178
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:24,889
He legalized drugs
in special zones?

179
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:27,347
It's more
than that.

180
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,758
Major Colvin lost
the necessary perspective

181
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,881
that is required for command.

182
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,257
We were all under pressure
to reduce crime before year end

183
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:40,021
and he responded poorly
to that pressure.

184
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:42,690
Pressured by who?
Mayor?

185
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:45,486
I'm just explaining to you

186
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:48,914
that the pressure was applied
all down the line

187
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:51,602
from headquarters
to the district commanders

188
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:54,252
to the shift
and sector supervisors.

189
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:57,743
So Colvin's 14% decline was bullshit.

190
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,834
And they're selling drugs
with police permission in Western?

191
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:06,920
The department is ready to shut that
mess down with mass arrests.

192
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,158
- I'm on top of it.
- Why don't you move?

193
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:12,678
The Mayor says wait.

194
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:14,525
Why?

195
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:18,387
I think he's gonna
make some kinda show.

196
00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:19,936
Spin it so that
I take the weight

197
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:21,910
for something that has
nothing to do with me

198
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:24,192
and everything to do
with the pressure

199
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:26,459
that my commanders
are getting from City Hall.

200
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,588
Going public and putting the
responsibility for this

201
00:13:35,635 --> 00:13:38,763
back at City Hall is the only
move I have left, right?

202
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,965
I mean, I spin Royce
before he spins me.

203
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:45,334
- And you want me to...
- Not you.

204
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,261
Your pal, Tony Gray.

205
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:51,083
If he's gonna take a run at Royce,
he's gonna need ammunition, right?

206
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:58,697
I don't have a relationship with Gray.
I do have one with you.

207
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:02,962
And Councilman?
You owe me.

208
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:10,827
- What's up, hotshot?
- I got a technical question.

209
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:12,419
Remember those
analog units we used

210
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:14,335
to use to pull cell
numbers out of the air?

211
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:15,945
The C.F. something-something...

212
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:18,393
Yeah, Cell Frequency
Identification Device.

213
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:21,268
- The triggerfish, yeah.
- That one, it could flag a number.

214
00:14:21,347 --> 00:14:22,917
Right, but the old analog machines?

215
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:24,607
We used to have to
follow the guy around

216
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,349
stay close while he used the phone.
New digitals...

217
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:29,799
bing, we just pull the number
right off the cell towers.

218
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,391
So, you got any down out at
Woodlawn that daddy can borrow?

219
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:33,983
- What about yours?
- What?

220
00:14:34,141 --> 00:14:36,053
City has three of 'em,
I remember right.

221
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:38,025
Homeland security
grant sent 'em to you

222
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:39,764
every big county department
in the state.

223
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,470
No fucking way.

224
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:45,813
Thanks.

225
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:52,574
- I doubted you, Tommy.
- I told you it was big.

226
00:14:52,606 --> 00:14:53,711
If we play it right.

227
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:56,460
He wants me to turn the
information over to Tony Gray...

228
00:14:56,555 --> 00:14:59,360
and let him use it, he figures if
Tony's running against the Mayor

229
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,360
he'll take aim at Royce
and not the department.

230
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:02,983
We may want to bring
Tony in on it

231
00:15:03,015 --> 00:15:04,626
keep him viable
against the Mayor.

232
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:07,283
But right now, you need to find
out what this is all about.

233
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:09,570
Firsthand... do you know
this, Major Colvin?

234
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,160
To shake hands, maybe.

235
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:14,419
If Burrell's painting
him the villain

236
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:17,389
Colvin might be anxious to tell
someone his side of the story.

237
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:29,535
McNulty, Major Crimes.

238
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:32,473
Sullivan, minor irritations.

239
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:36,438
You got anything back there that's like
the old C.F.I.D. but digital?

240
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:38,934
- For catching cell numbers?
- Catching who?

241
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:40,908
You know, a triggerfish machine.

242
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,789
Triggerfish. For cell numbers.

243
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:50,669
How 'bout I look around
there on my own?

244
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,021
Yes, this is Councilman
Carcetti over at the Hall.

245
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,411
I'm trying to reach Major Colvin.

246
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,976
<i>I'm sorry, but
he's on vacation. </i>

247
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,007
I'm aware of that, but I'm trying to
reach him on municipal business...

248
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,045
<i>Well, I could put you
through to his voice mail. </i>

249
00:16:15,064 --> 00:16:17,824
No, not his voice mail. I said I have
to reach him immediately...

250
00:16:17,837 --> 00:16:19,044
- <i>Immediately?</i>
- Right...

251
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:21,538
- <i>How about his cell phone?</i>
- His cell, it'll be fine...

252
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:23,923
<i>Alright. Four-oh... </i>

253
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:32,761
Alright, that's enough.

254
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,394
Yeah, I know, it hurts.

255
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:39,490
But your fists gonna
be like rocks after awhile.

256
00:16:43,422 --> 00:16:45,713
Justin, c'mere.

257
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:50,009
- Alright.
- I want you to push me on my chest.

258
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:52,031
You ain't got to do it hard.

259
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,848
That's how you was standin'.

260
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:58,721
You ain't have no weight
on your back foot.

261
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,312
That's right.

262
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:03,230
No center of gravity.
Plus, if you get your stance right...

263
00:17:03,324 --> 00:17:05,709
then you got the means
to put your hip into the punch.

264
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:08,173
Bub-bub, right?
Bub-bub.

265
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:09,895
That's where your power come from.

266
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:12,249
Yeah, but what happened
when we get hit?

267
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:14,634
- Say what?
- We get hit

268
00:17:14,713 --> 00:17:18,220
even with this pad,
you gonna get trucked.

269
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,478
All this stuff fallin' apart.

270
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:22,310
Yeah, the heavy bag, too.

271
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:23,906
Yeah, where you get this stuff at?

272
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,549
The Town of Bedrock?

273
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:29,971
Naw, he said nobody. So you
gonna have to wait right here.

274
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:32,577
What you mean wait right here?
You know who I am, boy?

275
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:36,195
Man say he want
to see Avon...

276
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:37,933
Makin' me wait
to see my own partner?

277
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:39,923
- He new, String.
- Fuck that.

278
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:43,382
Lotta new faces round here, man...
Way too many, you ask me.

279
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,099
Get the fuck out of here.

280
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:53,539
- Where Avon at?
- He'll be along shortly.

281
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,429
That's good 'cause
I came to see you, anyway.

282
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:58,246
What you need?

283
00:18:06,696 --> 00:18:08,528
I need you to hit somebody.

284
00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:10,281
Who we hittin'?

285
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,930
- Clay Davis.
- The Clay Davis?

286
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:15,635
Downtown Clay Davis?

287
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:17,682
That suppose to mean
somethin' to me, man?

288
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:21,038
- That nigger need to be got.
- Shit, String, murder ain't no thing.

289
00:18:21,386 --> 00:18:23,440
But this here is some
assassination shit...

290
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:25,841
Look, I tell you you gettin'
somebody, you getting him.

291
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:27,915
- I ain't askin'.
- Damn, String, I don't know...

292
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:30,422
Nigger, I got to remind you
who the fuck you work for?!

293
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:34,449
Hey, yo. I think Slim gonna have
to sit this one out, boss.

294
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:38,777
So you gonna hit a
state senator now, huh?

295
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:43,131
Yo, you kill a downtown nigger
like that the whole world

296
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:44,748
gonna stand up and take notice.

297
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:51,461
I'm talking about the state police,
federals, all of that.

298
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:54,645
You need a day-of-the-jackal
type motherfucker

299
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:56,205
basically to do
some shit like that.

300
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:57,895
Not a rough and tumble
nigga like Slim.

301
00:18:57,914 --> 00:19:00,654
- That nigger took our money, man.
- I seen it comin'.

302
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,339
Well. He got to go.

303
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,356
Naw, you a fucking businessman.
You'd wanna handle it like that.

304
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:09,269
You don't wanna get all gangster
wild with it an' shit, right?

305
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:13,890
What I tell you bout playin'
them fucking away games?

306
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:19,012
Yeah.

307
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:23,953
They saw your ghetto ass
comin' from miles away, nigger.

308
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:28,439
You got a fucking beef with them?
That shit is on you.

309
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:37,505
So... we aim this
at the nearest celltower

310
00:19:38,152 --> 00:19:40,348
the one that would
be the conduit for calls

311
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,537
coming to and from our boy, Bell.

312
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:45,655
And...

313
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:48,514
we let rip.

314
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:52,084
Fucking hell.

315
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:55,038
Look's like Baltimore white pages,
without any names.

316
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,518
But the pattern trace
will pull that down.

317
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,327
You know, if we know the approximate
time of Bell's call

318
00:20:00,356 --> 00:20:03,041
we can start just by pulling calls
off that tower, at that time.

319
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,215
That could be thousands.

320
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:07,169
Yeah, that's the baseline,
but we get a second hit

321
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:10,313
- and that list comes down to dozens.
- And after a third or fourth...

322
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:11,639
then we've got his number.

323
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:15,919
I can't believe that this was just
sitting over at I.S.D. gathering dust.

324
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,181
We're going to be on these
motherfuckers for real now, Lester.

325
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,495
They don't know about
this technology yet.

326
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:23,564
For once they can't
change and adjust.

327
00:20:23,785 --> 00:20:24,938
It's genius.

328
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:36,311
Oh, happy day

329
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:40,086
when jesus washed

330
00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:45,472
oh when he washed

331
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,610
he washed my sins away.

332
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:52,643
You need something?

333
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:54,570
How much you make?

334
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:56,150
What?

335
00:20:56,434 --> 00:20:58,614
On them tees?
How much you make?

336
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,226
A fair profit.
No more than that.

337
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,149
You should probably sell
sweats with hoodys.

338
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,792
Since the seasons changin' an' all.

339
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,903
Where you live at?

340
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,986
<i>Yellow Tops, Yellow Tops,
got them Yellow Tops. </i>

341
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:22,974
Bodie Broadus.

342
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:24,054
The man with the hands.

343
00:21:25,465 --> 00:21:27,961
I heard was, um, openin' up
a gym or somethin'.

344
00:21:28,056 --> 00:21:31,563
Yeah, tryin' to.
I'm lookin' to get up with Avon.

345
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:34,927
- Thought you was out.
- Man, that's why I'm came to you.

346
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,941
I mean, I feel like
the way we left it

347
00:21:36,988 --> 00:21:38,875
I can't just roll up
on the man, you know?

348
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,869
hey, yo, it's me.
Yo, I got that hitter here with me.

349
00:21:50,248 --> 00:21:52,207
Yeah, the soldier
that walked in and out.

350
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:54,371
Yeah, he want to see the top man.

351
00:21:56,993 --> 00:21:59,757
You slam shit like that
you gonna fall out one day.

352
00:22:01,794 --> 00:22:03,153
I'm good.

353
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:06,360
I'm tryin' to school you, boy

354
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:08,618
and you just don't wanna know.

355
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:15,552
I'm cool, Huck.
I'm good.

356
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:29,012
<i>Whitey sale,
whitey sale. </i>

357
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,334
One for three,
three for five.

358
00:22:40,223 --> 00:22:43,152
<i>Whitey sale, whitey sale. </i>

359
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:48,206
<i>Whitey sale, whitey sale!</i>

360
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:57,852
<i>Alright, so what you
want me to tell the man?</i>

361
00:22:58,023 --> 00:23:00,452
<i>Yo, I'll give word up
and then I'll hit you back. </i>

362
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:02,566
Shamrock.

363
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:04,866
4:40 P.M.

364
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:24,723
B- and-B enterprises...

365
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:28,952
- <i>We need to have lunch. </i>
- Alright, hold on, I'll call you back.

366
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:59,366
- Yo.
- <i>It's me. </i>

367
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:00,909
It's good.

368
00:24:04,881 --> 00:24:06,309
Yeah, it's me.

369
00:24:06,466 --> 00:24:09,109
<i>Yo, tell the hitter, tell him
the tall man pick him up. </i>

370
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:11,266
- <i>Right. </i>
- 4:47.

371
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:13,452
A seven minute window.

372
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:19,866
There's 892 phone numbers.
That's our baseline.

373
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:22,366
- We're on our way.
- Yep.

374
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,052
Stay the fuck there, man.

375
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:48,053
Yo.

376
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:01,366
Jimmy! On the clean phone.

377
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:04,152
He just hit your friend's number.

378
00:25:04,181 --> 00:25:06,895
The one off the business
card you gave me.

379
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:11,052
- The Western?
- His cell.

380
00:25:14,266 --> 00:25:16,881
Should we be worried
about this?

381
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:18,986
Naw.

382
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:23,581
- A boxing gym, huh?
- It ain't a proper one yet.

383
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:25,523
Why I asked to see you.

384
00:25:26,623 --> 00:25:29,099
So, what you know about takin'care
of something like that?

385
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,666
Not a damn thing.
But I know that sweet science.

386
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,438
And I got some kids
who are interested.

387
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:37,695
What I got a need for,
bro, is equipment.

388
00:25:38,209 --> 00:25:40,581
Man, these kids
gonna get rained on.

389
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:43,961
They need headgear,
they need guards, cups

390
00:25:44,403 --> 00:25:45,990
you know, so they
can take the hit.

391
00:25:46,023 --> 00:25:47,838
Shoot, you know what
I'm sayin', man.

392
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:50,409
I seen your picture on them
globe posters back in the day.

393
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:52,323
Undercard shit, maybe, you know.

394
00:25:52,438 --> 00:25:54,652
Yeah, but still,
you was golden gloves.

395
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:58,109
For a minute.
But I had a physical defect.

396
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,095
What, you had a glass jaw?

397
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:04,266
- Nah, forehead, nigger.
- Cranium shot'll do you wrong.

398
00:26:04,323 --> 00:26:06,495
Yeah, look here, man.

399
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:10,581
You seen new heavy bags?
Look, freestandin', man.

400
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,464
All you gotta do is add water.

401
00:26:12,465 --> 00:26:16,495
Then you got speed bags,
right there, right?

402
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:18,923
You got this headgear
right here. It's new.

403
00:26:19,225 --> 00:26:21,738
Look, protect the cheek
and the chin.

404
00:26:21,795 --> 00:26:22,526
You know.

405
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:27,181
And I know I can go around and
collect a dollar here, dollar there.

406
00:26:27,223 --> 00:26:30,023
But I'm trying to put together
a select group of people, right?

407
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:33,238
I call them my,
my gold circle club

408
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:35,995
and they gonna make
a substantial contribution

409
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:38,395
and just get
this thing rollin' right.

410
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:42,995
I mean, I'm gonna put their name and
picture up on the wall in the gym.

411
00:26:43,595 --> 00:26:45,938
What you tryin' to get
me to join a club?

412
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,538
Naw, man, I'm just sayin'.

413
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:49,663
There's all sorts of levels.

414
00:26:49,664 --> 00:26:52,866
We got the, the silver club,
we got the bronze club.

415
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:56,881
Man, for motherfuckers who really
don't want to dig that deep.

416
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:58,323
Come on, man, check it out.

417
00:26:58,738 --> 00:27:01,181
Nah, man, I ain't got no time
for this bullshit, man.

418
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:03,667
You know I don't want
my fucking name and face

419
00:27:03,686 --> 00:27:05,581
on no damn wall.
You crazy, nigger?

420
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:08,238
How much money you talkin' about?

421
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:13,838
$10,000.

422
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,723
I see you go through
all that for 10,000?

423
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:27,066
Man, slim, go get him $15,000 cash.

424
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:28,483
Yo.

425
00:27:29,507 --> 00:27:30,217
Shit.

426
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:32,093
A- ight, then.

427
00:27:32,112 --> 00:27:34,366
Hey, you take care
of them little niggas, hear?

428
00:27:34,395 --> 00:27:36,895
No doubt, bro.

429
00:27:58,181 --> 00:28:02,523
- Yeah. Yo, you talk to him?
- <i>Fat man wanna parlay. </i>

430
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:08,138
- Alright, you good, hook me up.
- <i>Yeah, a-ight. </i>

431
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:40,009
You check out what I sent you?

432
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:45,381
Yeah, your information was good.

433
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:49,095
So, we can talk on the
real side now, huh?

434
00:28:56,438 --> 00:28:58,340
<i>Tell your man
I'm good for tomorrow. </i>

435
00:28:58,631 --> 00:28:59,738
<i>Yo, I'll hit you back. </i>

436
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,695
- Now we're cooking.
- Cutting butter with a hot knife.

437
00:29:02,738 --> 00:29:06,295
Next time Stringer Bell takes a
call off the baseline he's ours.

438
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:07,838
Game over.

439
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,508
So, it ain't what
it might seem to you.

440
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,925
That man there
is my brother.

441
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:20,561
But if it keep on
like it been, then...

442
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:26,226
You got problems?

443
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:29,146
I stirred up some shit
with this Hampsterdam mess.

444
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,208
That's 'cause
you was behind that

445
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:34,155
that made me come
to you with this.

446
00:29:36,931 --> 00:29:39,793
Look like you and me both tryin'
to make sense of this game.

447
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,403
Speak your mind, Russell.

448
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:57,277
You two good?

449
00:29:58,967 --> 00:29:59,541
Yeah.

450
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:03,483
We got y'all out front.

451
00:30:03,682 --> 00:30:04,668
Let's go, p-square.

452
00:30:11,298 --> 00:30:12,142
You look healthy.

453
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:14,817
For a man who was gutshot.

454
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,430
You reached out to a third party

455
00:30:19,263 --> 00:30:21,890
who engaged me in the purpose
of holding your towers.

456
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,436
That third person's word
was your word

457
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:26,172
as he represented you.

458
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,016
That's right.

459
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:30,090
And I ran those
East Baltimore gentlemen off.

460
00:30:30,277 --> 00:30:32,236
I held up my end
of the agreement

461
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,391
at least for as long
as I was physically able.

462
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:36,470
You did.

463
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,497
Your man then set up
a meet at Butchie's bar.

464
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:42,484
Your man told Omar Little
that I was responsible

465
00:30:42,496 --> 00:30:45,757
for the torture of a young boy
who was close to Mr. Little's heart.

466
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:47,505
Your man

467
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:48,912
in effect

468
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,766
sought to have me hit.

469
00:30:50,977 --> 00:30:53,323
Omar told you that?
And you believe that motherfucker?

470
00:30:53,346 --> 00:30:56,079
He doesn't strike me as
a man who would tell stories

471
00:30:56,584 --> 00:30:58,074
even at the point of dying.

472
00:30:59,317 --> 00:30:59,868
Shit.

473
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:04,901
Proposition Joe package.

474
00:31:05,088 --> 00:31:07,939
The inner workings of your
organization don't concern me.

475
00:31:10,449 --> 00:31:12,373
If there's a way,
I mean, if my man...

476
00:31:14,308 --> 00:31:15,933
if he made
a mistake here

477
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:18,068
then I'm willing
to pay the cost.

478
00:31:24,437 --> 00:31:25,407
How can we fix it?

479
00:31:26,522 --> 00:31:27,319
You want money?

480
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:29,231
Money?

481
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:31,061
Yeah, this is business.

482
00:31:31,437 --> 00:31:33,243
Business is where you are now.

483
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:37,281
But what got you here is
your word and your reputation.

484
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:40,566
With that alone, you've still
got an open line to New York.

485
00:31:41,223 --> 00:31:43,111
Without it, you're done.

486
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:02,435
If my man's still on paper.

487
00:32:03,913 --> 00:32:06,481
I can put him in a spot
that got heavy artillery.

488
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:08,945
I ain't talkin'about pistols.
I'm talkin' about

489
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,420
mini-tech nines,
shotguns, they even got

490
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:12,874
grenades in that motherfucker.

491
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:14,798
That's an automatic fall.

492
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,144
So, I'm hopin' you could
keep that shit to five.

493
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:19,373
Look, if you hit the joint

494
00:32:19,581 --> 00:32:21,728
his people are gonna try
and take the wrap for it.

495
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:23,687
They gonna say all
that firepower is theirs.

496
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:27,077
So all you gotta do is just hit
him with the parole back-up.

497
00:32:27,522 --> 00:32:29,716
Look, I can't make no promises.

498
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,895
- It's gonna be a nickel, at least.
- Come on, man.

499
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,795
- Him and me...
- I'm gonna do my best, alright.

500
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:43,725
He's always at this place?

501
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:47,209
Naw, he come and go.

502
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,977
But it's the spot
since the war started.

503
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:12,043
He musta done
something to you.

504
00:33:15,738 --> 00:33:17,111
Naw, it's just business.

505
00:33:35,195 --> 00:33:37,596
Almost forgot.
This came in for you last night.

506
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:40,036
Said she called your cell phone,
but you didn't answer.

507
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:40,951
She had a nice voice.

508
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:42,101
Like a kitty-cat.

509
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:46,029
We're on.

510
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:49,912
<i>He say for you
to be there, half-pint. </i>

511
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:51,249
<i>Yeah, okay. </i>

512
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:01,244
Stringer Bell, that's him.

513
00:34:01,255 --> 00:34:03,402
- There it is.
- Yeah, but for how long?

514
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,264
He could toss that
burner at any moment.

515
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,854
I got Rhonda,
you raise Daniels.

516
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:10,312
Okay.

517
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,930
Ronnie, yeah, we're
on Stringer's phone.

518
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:16,470
Lieutenant.

519
00:34:16,564 --> 00:34:20,068
- You should go straight to the judge.
- I'll meet you there with an affidavit.

520
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,660
- Lester's raising Daniels.
- McNulty's calling Pearlman.

521
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:27,859
Watch that footwork, baby.

522
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:28,798
Alright.

523
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,053
Take it to him now.

524
00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:32,070
Take it to him now.

525
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,044
I'm a beast, coach.

526
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,288
Alright, boy, don't
be gloatin' on it.

527
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:41,540
Yo, when we gonna
have some real fights?

528
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:43,230
You know, one of them
tournament things.

529
00:34:43,241 --> 00:34:44,473
Yeah, we gladiators, son.

530
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,561
Y'all got more fire than skills.

531
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:49,221
You ain't ready for
no full-blown thing just yet.

532
00:34:50,124 --> 00:34:52,728
But I don't know, maybe it
be good for you all to spar

533
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,136
with some boys you don't know.

534
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:56,552
A nigga step in my house,
he gettin' dropped.

535
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,795
I met these fellas at that gym
over on Pennsylvania Avenue.

536
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:02,977
I'll see if
they wanna roll through.

537
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,423
A- ight?

538
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:05,100
A- ight. A-ight.

539
00:35:12,992 --> 00:35:14,893
You don't return
a councilman's calls?

540
00:35:17,168 --> 00:35:18,177
I'm off this week.

541
00:35:20,502 --> 00:35:22,202
Taking a little
accrued vacation.

542
00:35:22,531 --> 00:35:22,906
Yeah.

543
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:24,384
And I heard why.

544
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,551
I'm here for your side
of this story.

545
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:30,117
If I can't get that,
then whatever comes out of

546
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,806
Burrell's mouth is gonna stand.

547
00:35:31,876 --> 00:35:32,874
You good with that?

548
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,349
What did you do, Major?

549
00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:38,539
And why the fuck haven't
they shut it down?

550
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:41,264
We've seen that law enforcement
steam roller approach

551
00:35:41,287 --> 00:35:42,742
is just spitting in the wind.

552
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:45,686
I really think that you're
onto something here, Clarence.

553
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,918
But if you keep it up

554
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:49,287
before you know it,
they'll be calling you the most

555
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:50,389
dangerous man in america.

556
00:35:50,412 --> 00:35:53,004
Well, I know it may appear that
we're vulnerable here, huh?

557
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,233
But if we enforce the drug laws

558
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:57,614
everywhere else in the city,
aggressively

559
00:35:57,872 --> 00:36:01,026
how can they say we're not
a law-and-order administration.

560
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:03,231
Now there's got
to be a middle ground here

561
00:36:03,254 --> 00:36:04,427
that we have yet to find.

562
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:06,621
There's got to be some way
to accomplish this

563
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:08,697
without turning
everything upside down.

564
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:12,030
This used to be one
of my worst corners.

565
00:36:13,492 --> 00:36:14,524
This is the neighborhood

566
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:16,354
where a cop got shot
last summer, right?

567
00:36:16,377 --> 00:36:17,398
Dozerman.

568
00:36:17,644 --> 00:36:18,454
Looks quiet now.

569
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:22,759
So do most all my corners.

570
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:28,999
G- man.

571
00:36:36,538 --> 00:36:37,640
So, what's up?

572
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:39,412
Shut the door.

573
00:36:45,058 --> 00:36:46,865
In 10 minutes we're gonna
have an affidavit

574
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,448
for a city judge to sign:

575
00:36:49,363 --> 00:36:51,088
It's for Russell Bell's dirty cell.

576
00:36:51,193 --> 00:36:52,216
It's a good pull.

577
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:55,418
It is if Bay Wireless doesn't
take five days to process it.

578
00:36:56,169 --> 00:36:57,342
You owe me, Fitz.

579
00:36:58,046 --> 00:37:00,157
That whole port case
came down early behind

580
00:37:00,192 --> 00:37:01,823
some ugly shit in your house.

581
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,199
Now, I don't care how you do it,
but I need my wire today.

582
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:15,159
These guys were in radio cars
two months ago

583
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,482
chasing calls, clearing corners.

584
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:19,945
I pulled them to do
felony follow-up.

585
00:37:20,062 --> 00:37:23,711
More police work, less bullshit,
and that's why my crime is down.

586
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:25,982
My numbers are true.

587
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,395
What'd he do?

588
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:31,589
Church burglaries,
14 of 'em.

589
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:34,961
Let's go.

590
00:37:39,442 --> 00:37:39,993
Mademoiselle.

591
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:44,474
Is it aff-ee-ant
or aff-I-ant.

592
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,616
I've never been
clear on that.

593
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:53,915
You been hunting this guy Bell
for a long time, haven't you, Jimmy?

594
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:55,745
A while, yeah.

595
00:37:57,136 --> 00:37:58,661
Name's familiar to me.

596
00:37:59,705 --> 00:38:02,825
That the thing that we did
a few years back, was he the...

597
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:03,623
yeah.

598
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:07,531
What's done is done, Jimmy.

599
00:38:09,608 --> 00:38:11,836
Now, for your own fucking sake,
just let it go.

600
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:15,344
Come on.

601
00:38:18,424 --> 00:38:19,515
As the affiant

602
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:22,834
do you solemnly swear
and attest that the information

603
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:24,430
contained in this document...

604
00:38:24,899 --> 00:38:27,925
That's the most sign
ificant dropin crime in this district

605
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,946
in recent history.

606
00:38:31,887 --> 00:38:34,339
We still got some hard lookin'
boys out on them streets.

607
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:37,706
An' Sergeant, them
little mini-motorcycles

608
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:39,219
they keepin' me up at night.

609
00:38:39,723 --> 00:38:41,070
We're working on that.

610
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:43,768
I have been livin' in this part
of the city my whole life.

611
00:38:44,178 --> 00:38:45,504
And I can tell you something.

612
00:38:45,527 --> 00:38:47,346
We weren't any angels
when we were kids.

613
00:38:47,428 --> 00:38:50,360
And those are hard boys you
talkin' about, half of 'em

614
00:38:50,618 --> 00:38:51,964
they just playin' gangster.

615
00:38:52,551 --> 00:38:54,439
They no different
from what we were.

616
00:38:54,803 --> 00:38:57,219
Shirts and drawers
a little longer, is all.

617
00:38:58,779 --> 00:39:02,015
The one thing I do miss
about my neighborhood

618
00:39:02,038 --> 00:39:04,044
I'm talking about the
neighborhood I came up in.

619
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:05,478
See, we knew the police.

620
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:06,510
See?

621
00:39:06,663 --> 00:39:09,596
We had a white police officer,
our house was on his beat

622
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:10,651
on his foot beat

623
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:14,640
and he would be sitting out talking
to my mother damn near every night.

624
00:39:15,038 --> 00:39:17,122
I mean just sittin' out
on her stoop just talking.

625
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:20,199
And I'm telling you, this man,
his name was Frazier O'Leary.

626
00:39:20,563 --> 00:39:22,639
He even knew
my grandmother by name.

627
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:23,519
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:25,618
Now let's move on to the
tip-line information...

629
00:39:25,638 --> 00:39:26,553
I'm so sorry, baby.

630
00:39:26,588 --> 00:39:28,500
I'm real sorry,
but I was not finished.

631
00:39:29,005 --> 00:39:30,682
You see, let me
tell you something.

632
00:39:30,823 --> 00:39:34,225
I have not seen that
face-to-face policein'

633
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,785
in a long while.

634
00:39:35,937 --> 00:39:37,181
In a very long while.

635
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:38,424
Until last week.

636
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:42,659
A young officer, black officer,
came by my stoop, I was sitting out

637
00:39:42,823 --> 00:39:43,914
gave me his card.

638
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:47,480
His name was Reggie Ballard,
is his name, right?

639
00:39:47,656 --> 00:39:49,236
And he said,
and he talked to me.

640
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,257
We just talked.

641
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,251
And see now I know
his name and face

642
00:39:52,509 --> 00:39:54,092
and he knows
my name and face.

643
00:39:54,585 --> 00:39:56,603
You see?
And I'm going to tell you something.

644
00:39:56,696 --> 00:39:58,289
That is how it should be.

645
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:05,373
My son wants to open up
one of them snowball

646
00:40:05,408 --> 00:40:06,440
stands on the street.

647
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,175
Do he need
a permit for this?

648
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,248
You ever seen a Westside
community meeting like this one?

649
00:40:13,642 --> 00:40:15,796
In fact, folks downtown
at minor privileges

650
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:18,984
tell me that stands aren't allowed
in the citywide way at all.

651
00:40:19,492 --> 00:40:22,823
Now they do say it is possible
to have a snowball stand

652
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:24,266
behind the sidewalk...

653
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,511
Why are you really
down here, Councilman?

654
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,886
I mean, this ain't
even your district.

655
00:40:36,543 --> 00:40:37,469
I'm interested.

656
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,202
I have the Public
Safety Subcommittee.

657
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,502
See that buding there?

658
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:50,068
Was the old Stryker building.

659
00:40:50,842 --> 00:40:51,874
It was a funeral parlor

660
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:55,287
the last stop before the cemetery
for Westside white folk

661
00:40:55,428 --> 00:40:57,750
back when there were
still some of those around.

662
00:40:57,832 --> 00:40:59,169
Right 'bout the time that...

663
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,099
Jim Crow was breakin' up
back in the early 60s

664
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,081
somebody ask
old man Stryker, they say

665
00:41:05,105 --> 00:41:09,961
"Stryker, you gonna change your
policy and start buryin' black folk. "

666
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,057
And Stryker said

667
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:15,612
"yeah, on one condition:

668
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,181
If I can do all of them at once. "

669
00:41:22,251 --> 00:41:22,978
That's sick.

670
00:41:23,928 --> 00:41:24,879
You know somethin'?

671
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:27,945
I had a lot of
respect for that man.

672
00:41:29,165 --> 00:41:30,620
'Cause, unlike most folks

673
00:41:31,171 --> 00:41:32,731
I always knew where he stood.

674
00:41:34,045 --> 00:41:35,312
I'm doing my job.

675
00:41:41,883 --> 00:41:43,432
Look, I done showed
you the good.

676
00:41:44,804 --> 00:41:46,446
Come on, let me show
you the ugly.

677
00:42:00,992 --> 00:42:03,397
Hey, how come so quick?

678
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:05,544
Stringer Bell's given name?

679
00:42:05,884 --> 00:42:06,459
Russell.

680
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,124
For now.

681
00:42:09,098 --> 00:42:09,755
Achmed.

682
00:42:16,246 --> 00:42:18,076
We're on the top
of the mountain.

683
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:27,469
<i>Come get 'em,
come get 'em. </i>

684
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:41,405
This is it?

685
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:43,123
One of three.

686
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,188
How did you
make this happen?

687
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:49,000
I just did it.

688
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:54,513
I got tired of hearin' folks
talk about what needed

689
00:42:54,548 --> 00:42:55,628
to be done or...

690
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,380
what they would do
if it were up to them.

691
00:42:58,404 --> 00:43:00,351
<i>Got them bottle rockets,
bottle rockets. </i>

692
00:43:00,398 --> 00:43:02,685
So, what, this is about
you making a mark?

693
00:43:03,975 --> 00:43:07,248
Nah, I ain't analyzed it
all that deep.

694
00:43:08,363 --> 00:43:10,501
I ain't claimin' no kind
of victory, neither.

695
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,477
I will say,
I'm glad I tried.

696
00:43:18,442 --> 00:43:19,579
Go on, Councilman.

697
00:43:21,397 --> 00:43:22,722
I'll wait for you down here.

698
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,139
You're not comin'?

699
00:43:27,426 --> 00:43:29,186
What you're gonna
see ain't pretty.

700
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,134
But you're safe.

701
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:33,234
<i>W.M.D'S.,
Got them W.M.D'S.</i>

702
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:35,544
Think you need to take
this journey your ownself.

703
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,369
<i>Yellow tops.
Yellow tops, right here. </i>

704
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:21,942
I ordered one for you.

705
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:23,995
Thanks.

706
00:44:25,973 --> 00:44:26,994
Surprised I called?

707
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:27,780
A little.

708
00:44:28,894 --> 00:44:30,114
After the way we left it.

709
00:44:32,624 --> 00:44:33,856
I'm a type-a, Jimmy.

710
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,061
People like me break things.

711
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:40,768
When I slow down, or when I take
a minute to think about it, I...

712
00:44:43,536 --> 00:44:45,530
Is that your idea
of an apology?

713
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:49,341
I didn't drive an hour
up 95 to apologize.

714
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:52,426
I missed you.

715
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:59,308
I missed you,
too, I guess.

716
00:45:00,317 --> 00:45:02,792
Still, seems like a long way
to come just to tell me that

717
00:45:02,862 --> 00:45:04,962
then turn around
and drive back down to D.C.

718
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,085
I'm not driving back tonight.

719
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:16,075
So what's goin' on?

720
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,606
You working on a case?

721
00:45:18,474 --> 00:45:19,236
It's a good one.

722
00:45:20,996 --> 00:45:23,085
How about you?
Anything interestin'?

723
00:45:24,269 --> 00:45:27,049
I did hear a crazy
Baltimore story

724
00:45:27,882 --> 00:45:29,947
you know through
the rumor of Washington.

725
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:31,613
Really?

726
00:45:32,516 --> 00:45:33,208
Some...

727
00:45:33,912 --> 00:45:37,196
renegade police commander
takes it on himself to

728
00:45:38,006 --> 00:45:40,094
I dunno, legalize drugs
in the precinct.

729
00:45:41,243 --> 00:45:42,768
Mayor doesn't
even know about it.

730
00:45:43,565 --> 00:45:44,457
Can you believe that?

731
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:46,639
Crazy story.

732
00:45:47,225 --> 00:45:48,211
Someone...

733
00:45:49,677 --> 00:45:51,049
I think it's Colvin.

734
00:45:52,574 --> 00:45:53,278
You know him?

735
00:45:56,448 --> 00:45:57,809
No, I can't say that I do.

736
00:46:00,378 --> 00:46:02,243
Still, I think
it's funny that some...

737
00:46:03,522 --> 00:46:07,426
water-cooler talker down in D.C.
Knows any Baltimore cop's name.

738
00:46:10,919 --> 00:46:12,057
I was just wondering.

739
00:46:22,116 --> 00:46:23,817
Listen, I'm...

740
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,380
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, I think so.

741
00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:30,973
Goodnight.

742
00:46:39,245 --> 00:46:41,450
Damn, man, I miss
this crib already.

743
00:46:42,904 --> 00:46:45,297
Yeah, well, you spendin' a lot
of time at the other spot

744
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:46,811
doin' what
you gotta do, huh.

745
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:47,620
Yeah.

746
00:46:48,887 --> 00:46:51,702
Man, it's a shame we got to deal
with this Marlo bullshit, man.

747
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:54,013
I mean if I had taken
care of that earlier, man...

748
00:46:54,107 --> 00:46:55,925
There's always gonna
be a Marlo, man.

749
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:57,837
No Marlo, no game.

750
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:01,904
But you coulda dealt
with that shit a little sooner.

751
00:47:01,939 --> 00:47:03,792
I mean, yeah, but
you know what I'm sayin'

752
00:47:03,816 --> 00:47:05,317
don't let it lay
on you like that.

753
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:09,646
Tonight, I mean, I'm gonna kick
back and just enjoy this view.

754
00:47:11,464 --> 00:47:12,965
I mean, look at this shit.

755
00:47:13,118 --> 00:47:14,502
Can you fucking
believe this?

756
00:47:14,795 --> 00:47:16,989
I mean, I got a crib
that's overlooking the harbor.

757
00:47:17,012 --> 00:47:19,699
This is the same place we used
to run through this motherfucker.

758
00:47:19,722 --> 00:47:21,622
We had every security
guard in there...

759
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:22,725
following us.

760
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,980
As they should have.

761
00:47:23,992 --> 00:47:25,845
True, true.

762
00:47:25,892 --> 00:47:27,511
And then there was
that one time...

763
00:47:27,546 --> 00:47:28,133
Toy store.

764
00:47:28,226 --> 00:47:31,570
Hell yeah, I told your ass
not to steal the badminton set.

765
00:47:31,616 --> 00:47:34,369
What you gonna do
with a fucking net

766
00:47:34,533 --> 00:47:37,173
and a racket and we
ain't got no yard.

767
00:47:39,178 --> 00:47:41,384
Uou like, "yo, that white boy
ain't gonna jump over

768
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:43,140
that counter
and come chase after me. "

769
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,066
He sure did, though.

770
00:47:44,078 --> 00:47:45,228
And he said, "whschooooo".

771
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:46,365
I said, "what the fuck... "

772
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:48,055
He was on your ass
like Carl Lewis.

773
00:47:48,078 --> 00:47:49,145
Fist was rolled up.

774
00:47:49,228 --> 00:47:51,327
Your ass was runnin' too,
fast as you could.

775
00:47:51,676 --> 00:47:54,128
Punching yourself in the chest
looking all mad an' shit.

776
00:47:55,148 --> 00:47:56,497
That shit was crazy, man.

777
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:58,785
Right here, too, man,
right there.

778
00:47:59,535 --> 00:48:00,204
Goddamn.

779
00:48:02,738 --> 00:48:05,417
Can you imagine, man, if I had
the money that I have now, man

780
00:48:05,428 --> 00:48:08,431
I coulda bought half
this waterfront property.

781
00:48:08,443 --> 00:48:09,464
Goddamnit.

782
00:48:11,469 --> 00:48:13,170
Forget about that
for awhile, man.

783
00:48:15,307 --> 00:48:16,339
Just dream with me.

784
00:48:20,175 --> 00:48:22,040
We ain't got
to dream no more, man.

785
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,019
We got real shit

786
00:48:27,146 --> 00:48:28,037
real estate

787
00:48:28,563 --> 00:48:29,443
we can touch.

788
00:48:37,275 --> 00:48:39,211
I can't get too
fucked up tonight, man.

789
00:48:39,598 --> 00:48:41,909
I got some shit I gotta
do on the site tomorrow.

790
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:46,432
Plus, the fucking polack
we got working for us, man

791
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,438
I gotta pull his coat.

792
00:48:49,576 --> 00:48:52,297
If he had anything to do with
that Clay Davis bullshit, man

793
00:48:52,321 --> 00:48:54,409
I'm gonna have to cut
his money, little faggot.

794
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:56,884
What time y'all meetin'?

795
00:49:03,804 --> 00:49:05,110
What time, 12...

796
00:49:06,764 --> 00:49:07,620
I think, why?

797
00:49:08,007 --> 00:49:09,872
You need me to do
something for you?

798
00:49:11,796 --> 00:49:13,861
Naw, just seeing where
you going to be at.

799
00:49:16,616 --> 00:49:17,977
You need to relax
more, man.

800
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:22,493
All in time, is right.

801
00:49:23,643 --> 00:49:24,346
I will.

802
00:49:26,634 --> 00:49:29,133
You know I don't take
my work... too seriously.

803
00:49:30,822 --> 00:49:31,701
That's right.

804
00:49:35,502 --> 00:49:36,499
It's just business.

805
00:49:47,242 --> 00:49:48,415
Us, motherfucker.

806
00:49:52,165 --> 00:49:53,163
To us, man.

807
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:35,538
Hit him, Andre,
go get him.

808
00:50:36,059 --> 00:50:37,056
Come on, Spider.

809
00:50:43,614 --> 00:50:45,268
- Alright?
- I'm good, I'm good.

810
00:50:46,108 --> 00:50:46,765
Alright.

811
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:47,962
Alright, Ditty, you up.

812
00:50:48,865 --> 00:50:49,850
You, Justin.

813
00:50:51,762 --> 00:50:53,686
C'mon, boy, I'm callin' your name.

814
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:00,890
Alright, listen up, we're gonna
have three two-minute rounds.

815
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,485
Watch the low blows.

816
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,623
Touch gloves.

817
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:09,274
And...

818
00:51:10,635 --> 00:51:11,632
Let's go, Justin.

819
00:51:14,048 --> 00:51:14,647
Come on.

820
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:16,465
That's good, that's good.

821
00:51:20,793 --> 00:51:21,779
Come on, man.

822
00:51:23,221 --> 00:51:23,843
Block that.

823
00:51:23,867 --> 00:51:26,588
He leadin' left
and punchin' right, Justin.

824
00:51:26,623 --> 00:51:28,265
Move towards his weak side.

825
00:51:28,277 --> 00:51:29,696
He only come up
to your waist.

826
00:51:30,035 --> 00:51:31,114
Oh, man, bell.

827
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:34,633
That was a quick two minutes.

828
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:35,536
Yeah, I know.

829
00:51:35,724 --> 00:51:37,683
Get you some water, boy,
and spit it out.

830
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:41,880
You alright?

831
00:51:42,419 --> 00:51:43,041
Dizzy.

832
00:51:43,346 --> 00:51:45,950
That's why the hell I keep
tellin' you got to breathe, boy.

833
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:47,921
So, what?
You had enough?

834
00:51:48,449 --> 00:51:49,364
Nah, I'm good.

835
00:51:49,657 --> 00:51:51,229
Alright, alright.

836
00:51:53,184 --> 00:51:55,037
- Let's go, Justin.
- Let's go, Justin.

837
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:01,017
Jab, Justin, jab.

838
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,240
Hey, we're up.

839
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,307
Here it is.

840
00:52:18,589 --> 00:52:20,630
<i>- It's me, man.
- You heard from the fat man?</i>

841
00:52:20,653 --> 00:52:21,111
<i>Yeah. </i>

842
00:52:21,251 --> 00:52:23,351
<i>We low, right?
One mark shy of the mark. </i>

843
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,782
<i>Yeah, it's light. </i>

844
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,335
<i>Cherry says it's light. </i>

845
00:52:26,921 --> 00:52:28,939
<i>Well, tell the man
I'm doin' what needs done. </i>

846
00:52:29,056 --> 00:52:30,182
<i>A-ight, I'll tell him. </i>

847
00:52:30,874 --> 00:52:32,739
<i>- Oh, an' that other thing...
- Huh?</i>

848
00:52:33,021 --> 00:52:34,581
<i>Them two hitters
you asked after. </i>

849
00:52:34,628 --> 00:52:35,648
<i>They good with it. </i>

850
00:52:35,754 --> 00:52:36,775
<i>Not on the phone. </i>

851
00:52:39,649 --> 00:52:40,165
That's it.

852
00:52:41,843 --> 00:52:42,582
We got!

853
00:52:49,696 --> 00:52:50,412
Good work.

854
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:55,925
I guess this is pertinent.

855
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:27,367
Ain't no need
to go back out.

856
00:53:27,977 --> 00:53:29,455
You ain't got
to prove nothin'.

857
00:53:29,784 --> 00:53:31,783
Shoot, my momma hit me
harder than that.

858
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:33,882
I still got a chance,
he gettin' tired.

859
00:53:34,551 --> 00:53:35,407
Drink and spit.

860
00:53:39,325 --> 00:53:39,912
Ready.

861
00:53:40,205 --> 00:53:41,956
You more than ready, boy.

862
00:53:42,143 --> 00:53:43,082
You a game rooster.

863
00:53:44,595 --> 00:53:45,604
Let's go, Justin!

864
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:03,170
Is there an alley entrance?

865
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,704
Boarded up on both sides.

866
00:54:06,173 --> 00:54:07,967
We gonna have to go
through the front.

867
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:10,994
That's a change
for you, isn't it?

868
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,628
You just be ready, bow tie.

869
00:54:15,179 --> 00:54:16,645
Know what I'm talkin' about?

870
00:54:25,277 --> 00:54:26,215
Breathe, boy.

871
00:54:26,368 --> 00:54:27,025
Breathe.

872
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:34,591
Touch gloves.

873
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:42,076
How I do?

874
00:54:42,123 --> 00:54:43,777
You still got
plenty to learn.

875
00:54:44,024 --> 00:54:45,549
But on the heart side?

876
00:54:46,379 --> 00:54:47,423
You did good.

877
00:54:52,279 --> 00:54:53,546
Go on, soldier.

878
00:54:53,663 --> 00:54:54,919
You done for today.

879
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:03,922
Oh, I can see it
all clearly now.

880
00:55:03,939 --> 00:55:06,942
Between you and them subcontractors
and that motherfuckin' politician

881
00:55:06,989 --> 00:55:08,559
you all had me
in a spin, right.

882
00:55:08,629 --> 00:55:10,706
- Mr. Bell, I don't know...
- Little man!

883
00:55:11,093 --> 00:55:13,016
We gonna get all
this shit sorted out.

884
00:55:13,075 --> 00:55:14,823
And hey, if the shit
don't come up right

885
00:55:14,846 --> 00:55:17,286
one way or another
you gonna pay for this shit.

886
00:55:17,332 --> 00:55:18,623
Look, I understand you're angry

887
00:55:18,646 --> 00:55:21,334
but at the same time you can see
the progress we've made in here.

888
00:55:21,356 --> 00:55:21,778
Progress.

889
00:55:21,802 --> 00:55:24,664
Now I honestly don't know what
passed between you and Senator Davis.

890
00:55:24,675 --> 00:55:26,763
But if you're unhappy
with Clayton's performance

891
00:55:26,787 --> 00:55:28,230
then you have
to work that out...

892
00:55:28,819 --> 00:55:29,523
Oh, shit.

893
00:55:29,851 --> 00:55:30,860
Oh God.

894
00:55:32,057 --> 00:55:33,452
Oh, God, no.

895
00:56:14,491 --> 00:56:15,629
I ain't strapped.

896
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,707
Look, man, I ain't involved.

897
00:56:24,998 --> 00:56:27,555
I ain't involved in
that gangster bullshit no more.

898
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:36,452
What you niggas want, man?

899
00:56:38,223 --> 00:56:39,079
Money?

900
00:56:43,413 --> 00:56:44,586
Is that it?!

901
00:56:46,053 --> 00:56:49,478
'Cause if it is, man, I can be
a better friend to y'all alive.

902
00:56:52,105 --> 00:56:53,736
You still don't
get it, do you?

903
00:56:55,906 --> 00:56:57,478
This ain't about
your money, bro.

904
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,270
Your boy gave you up.

905
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:03,355
That's right.

906
00:57:04,058 --> 00:57:06,274
And we ain't had
to torture his ass, neither.

907
00:57:23,283 --> 00:57:24,139
This seem like...

908
00:57:25,711 --> 00:57:27,858
I can't say nothin'
to change y'all minds.

909
00:57:41,177 --> 00:57:43,218
Well, get on with it,
motherfuckers!
