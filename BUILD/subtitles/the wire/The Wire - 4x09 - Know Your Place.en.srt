1
00:00:20,017 --> 00:00:21,417
But it's a snail, you see,

2
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:23,801
and it go--
it go, "meow."

3
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:26,842
It's a what? What?

4
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,006
It meows.

5
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:29,980
Then it ooze all up
right up to his belly--

6
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:32,035
Like it's his pet and shit.

7
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:35,215
Yo, y'all niggers
watch too many cartoons. I swear.

8
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:40,852
See, this is what's wrong
with the justice system right here.

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,060
Niggers get locked up,
and they don't stay that way.

10
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,375
They make it hard
to take this shit serious.

11
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:48,545
- What? You snitchin' or something?
- Shit. No, man.

12
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:50,318
You know they only gave me,
like, 4, right?

13
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:52,342
Know what I'm saying,
I done 15 months.

14
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,616
So, in good time, I'm like,
"man, what the fuck?"

15
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:55,744
Shit.

16
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:56,997
Yeah, man.

17
00:00:57,415 --> 00:00:58,506
So...

18
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,439
Yeah, man.
It ain't like it was,

19
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:02,892
but it'll do.

20
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,314
So, who we slinging for?

21
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,695
Marlo Stanfield.

22
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:09,351
- Come on, come on!
- Yo, man. Yeah.

23
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,105
I was getting this nice
package from Slim Charles, but...

24
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:14,495
Marlo got the muscle
to hold us down,

25
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:15,788
so that's where we at.

26
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:18,213
Shit.
One boss same as the next, man.

27
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,308
Make sure they
ain't slick, all right.

28
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,721
Hey, yo, little Kev,

29
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:23,769
I told you about
the boy Poot, right?

30
00:01:24,582 --> 00:01:26,575
Pussy hound.
You just home?

31
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,296
- How long in?
- 15 months.

32
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:31,583
- You got laid yet?
- Shit. I think I already been burnt.

33
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:34,105
Shit. I might need a ride
to the clinic today.

34
00:01:36,077 --> 00:01:38,406
I see ain't shit changed
around this joint.

35
00:01:38,746 --> 00:01:40,048
On the wall, gents.

36
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:42,552
Make this easy on all of us.

37
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:44,478
Which one of you's
is little Kevin?

38
00:01:45,565 --> 00:01:47,178
Come on, fellows.
It ain't no big deal.

39
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:49,312
We just need some face time
with the motherfucker.

40
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:50,601
Your name Kevin?

41
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,200
No. This is, uh...
Poot.

42
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:56,004
- I'm Poot, yo.
- Poot. Right.

43
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:57,976
Didn't you get locked up
or shot or something?

44
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:59,808
Society say
I deserve another chance.

45
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,413
Yeah. Let's see. Which one
of these dickheads is Little Kevin?

46
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,883
- Man, I don't know no Kevin.
- Society can bite my dick.

47
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:06,878
Come on, Bodie.
I know this kid works with you.

48
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,577
- Your name?
- Do I look little to you?

49
00:02:08,617 --> 00:02:12,749
All right. Fuck this. Everyone
under 150 pounds or 5'6" is in the cab.

50
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:14,615
You, you, and you.

51
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:17,945
Unless I see birth certificates saying
otherwise, you're my little Kevins.

52
00:02:17,985 --> 00:02:20,549
And if that don't get it,
we're coming the fuck back.

53
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:21,682
All right?

54
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:27,148
That's fucked up, yo.

55
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:31,850
You got any paper on you?

56
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:33,293
Man, fuck if I know.

57
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:36,617
These police out here knew how
to flip it even just a little,

58
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:38,618
my shit would be in handcuffs.

59
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:39,723
You know?

60
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,132
They don't know shit.

61
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:43,501
Damn!

62
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:48,632
4x09 Know Your Place

63
00:04:31,612 --> 00:04:32,757
You my ride?

64
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:38,352
I'm your motherfucking savior,
is what I am.

65
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:42,144
Told y'all Andre was lying on me, yo.

66
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:43,446
I didn't do it for you.

67
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:45,662
Fact is...

68
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:48,514
if I could work back on
whatever cases I already caught,

69
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:50,662
you might be going
right back inside.

70
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:52,004
I know.

71
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,335
So who did kill that delivery girl?

72
00:04:54,414 --> 00:04:55,335
I don't know.

73
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:56,621
Know it wasn't Andre.

74
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,753
His blood don't run
that kind of cold.

75
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:01,973
Who he getting his package from?

76
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:05,814
Saying I could go back
to the crib and bear up,

77
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:07,616
find some things for you
if you want me to.

78
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:10,044
- You owe me, motherfucker.
- I'm saying I know I do, man.

79
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,466
If you want to pay down this debt,

80
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,130
you know what you
gotta do for me?

81
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:15,819
No more bodies.

82
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,205
No more fucking
bodies from you.

83
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,562
No more comebacks
or get-evens on this.

84
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:26,172
No more killing.

85
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:31,348
You owe me your word.

86
00:05:35,562 --> 00:05:36,741
All right, man.

87
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:38,100
No bodies on me.

88
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:45,480
Really want to ease my mind,

89
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,987
you'll let me drive you down
to Aberdeen rail station,

90
00:05:48,026 --> 00:05:49,409
put you on a northbound train.

91
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:50,646
Naw, man.

92
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,343
Baltimore's all I know.

93
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:54,806
You know what it is like, homey.

94
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:58,438
Man gotta live what he know, right?

95
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,449
You're absolutely right. There are
many significant factors to consider,

96
00:06:04,508 --> 00:06:07,828
but getting crime under control
is key to sparking investment here,

97
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:10,907
- jumpstarting growth.
- If you make it safe, they will come.

98
00:06:10,986 --> 00:06:13,463
I hate to begin our beautiful
relationship with my hand out,

99
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:16,907
but I'm told that two federal grants
to my office dry up this year.

100
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:18,663
That's right.
Come the first of the year,

101
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,346
those D.O.J. Grants evaporate,
and you're out 12 prosecutors.

102
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:24,176
I was hoping you'd be able
to absorb that in the general fund,

103
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,755
maybe even throw in a little bit more,

104
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:28,329
make it competitive with the P.D.
and attorney general's jobs--

105
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,294
Starts the turnover.
It's killing us.

106
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,748
This would be the time to do it.

107
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:33,254
I mean, we're over the revenue

108
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:35,406
expected for this point
in the fiscal year

109
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:36,709
next to the real estate market.

110
00:06:36,748 --> 00:06:38,821
How much past?
'Cause I want to come out of the box

111
00:06:38,872 --> 00:06:41,983
with a big bump in police salaries, in
particular, the commissioner's salary,

112
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:43,483
which needs to jump, like, 50 grand.

113
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:46,716
A good guess would be a one-shot surplus
of about 20 million.

114
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,949
But that's rainy-day money
for more than crime.

115
00:06:49,015 --> 00:06:51,417
Around north avenue,
the schools are running a deficit.

116
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:54,450
Excuse me. Did you say
a 50,000 bump for Ervin Burrell?

117
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,217
Well, no, not for Burrell per se.

118
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:57,854
For the next police commissioner, then.

119
00:06:57,913 --> 00:07:00,023
- That's what you mean?
- Looking ahead makes sense.

120
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:02,203
Because firing him would
upset a good-size block

121
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:04,718
of my constituency, not
to mention the ministers.

122
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:06,910
And the budget chair
might have a difficult time

123
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,884
allowing a higher salary
to be approved.

124
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:12,018
In fact, I can guarantee
if that proposal's in the budget--

125
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:13,680
your first, for the record--

126
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:16,253
the Bill won't come out
of committee intact.

127
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,607
I'm just saying that in the event
commissioner Burrell were to leave

128
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:22,888
we'd want to bump that salary
In order to attract the best candidates;

129
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:26,034
in particular, the best African-American
candidates from across the nation.

130
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:28,758
With 3 years left in his term,
why would he leave?

131
00:07:30,353 --> 00:07:32,439
Councilman, what may not have
been obvious to you

132
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,155
on the public safety subcommittee

133
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:37,984
is that the budget process is
a carefully-Orchestrated ballet,

134
00:07:38,222 --> 00:07:41,156
a cooperative effort between
the branches of government.

135
00:07:41,223 --> 00:07:42,304
Well, Madam President,

136
00:07:42,323 --> 00:07:46,461
the nuances of that cooperative effort
are beginning to come into focus for me.

137
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,625
Thank you, Madam President.

138
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:05,334
Come on in, everyone.

139
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:06,652
Don't wait by the door.

140
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:08,716
Duquan, you're here.

141
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:10,708
Randy, you're here.

142
00:08:11,327 --> 00:08:12,446
No. You two switch.

143
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:14,460
Calvin, you're here
in the front.

144
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,761
Quenice, you're here.

145
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:17,189
Mike, you're here.

146
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:18,595
Destiny, here.

147
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:20,477
Myesha, here.

148
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:22,111
Dashonda, here.

149
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:24,961
Come on. Keep moving.
Don't stop at the door. Come in.

150
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:26,139
Let's get started.

151
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,740
Mike could be a problem.

152
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,971
How so?

153
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:44,134
Your boy been assigned to
what they called a major crimes unit.

154
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:45,172
Meaning what?

155
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:48,074
They the motherfuckers
that did the last 3 city wiretaps--

156
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:50,323
One where they bugged
Barksdale's office,

157
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,866
another where they hit
Kentel up in Park Heights.

158
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,866
And the last one-- Shit.

159
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,587
They was all up on
Stringer Bell's cellphone.

160
00:08:57,898 --> 00:08:59,666
You ain't still using
burners, is you?

161
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,280
I'm dumping them every two weeks.

162
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,494
Not good enough.

163
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:05,199
You read that.

164
00:09:05,492 --> 00:09:08,300
You'll see the Stringer
was changing his number every damn day,

165
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:10,215
and they still pulled
the motherfucker's voice

166
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:12,083
off a goddamn cellphone tower.

167
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,530
City police did that?

168
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:18,968
Where'd you get this?

169
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:21,042
Courthouse,
clerk's office.

170
00:09:22,482 --> 00:09:26,134
Hey, the shit's open to the public
after they finish prosecuting your ass.

171
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:29,343
You need to lose
them cellphones, son.

172
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,550
Me-- I ain't as so much
as touched a burner in a year.

173
00:09:57,777 --> 00:10:00,525
5'9" and 3/8?

174
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:01,775
You got it.

175
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,982
Now, hold the measure
and spread your arms out to the side.

176
00:10:05,242 --> 00:10:06,446
What you got?

177
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:07,938
I want one.

178
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:09,533
So, your cat can eat 'em?

179
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,092
Oh, how'd you find them?

180
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:16,307
I went to the calculators.

181
00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:20,642
Give me that.
Give it here.

182
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:21,845
The same.

183
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,148
Your height and your arm span--
Identical.

184
00:10:26,077 --> 00:10:27,083
Quenice?

185
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:28,878
See, look.
You about to get me in trouble.

186
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:30,990
So, you say you like to box, right?

187
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,077
You must have some kind of reach.

188
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:36,311
Everything cheap on computers
if you know where to look for it.

189
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:39,508
Yo, this mean the price
I'm getting from the Koreans.

190
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,385
Yo, they still
marking it up some.

191
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:42,579
They gotta be.

192
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:44,486
I can make twice
as much using this here.

193
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:47,912
Can't.

194
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:55,680
All this along the lower Patapsco,
Westport area

195
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:57,014
is ready for a turn.

196
00:10:57,081 --> 00:10:59,499
The proximity to downtown
and the B.W. parkway

197
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:02,173
make it ideal for Washington commuters.
That's a given.

198
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:03,298
Anything to speed it up?

199
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:04,497
A harbor promenade could work

200
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,185
going west from both sides
of the bridge.

201
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:09,149
The south harbor promenade
brought to you by--

202
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:10,580
Mayor Thomas Carcetti--

203
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:12,246
And the citizens of Baltimore.

204
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:13,782
Doesn't quite have the same ring

205
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:15,983
as a stadium or an aquarium
expansion, does it?

206
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:17,477
- It's a start.
- Further east,

207
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:19,316
you've got the locust point
marine terminal,

208
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:21,785
which, unfortunately,
is still a working enterprise,

209
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:24,451
and the further you go
into Brooklyn Curtis bay,

210
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,818
the more the skyline disappears.

211
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,184
We lose the Washington crowd.

212
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:30,016
For that waterfront,
you're gonna need a different draw.

213
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:31,877
- Casinos?
- Oh, the urban planning default?

214
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:34,108
I don't want the kind of crime
that comes with casinos.

215
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:35,407
Tax base is tax base.

216
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,919
This is where I get off the boat.

217
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:39,253
It's one thing to sell
waterfront for tax base,

218
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:41,686
but now you're just sucking
paychecks out of my community.

219
00:11:41,753 --> 00:11:42,986
Well, it was just a thought.

220
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,454
And, anyway,
we're getting ahead of ourselves.

221
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:47,687
This is just the first
long meeting of many.

222
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:49,421
So, thanks to everyone,

223
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:51,226
and we'll continue this later.

224
00:11:57,338 --> 00:11:59,746
Madam President,
a word with you?

225
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,364
Do you have a minute?

226
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:05,701
You and me got
a problem already.

227
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:09,290
Just trying to help,
guide you through the process,

228
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:12,927
Mr. Mayor-Elect.

229
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:16,823
Felt more like you were dragging me
across a minefield, Narice.

230
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,192
- Why you so pissed off at me?
- Look.

231
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:21,678
Clarence shouldn't have run again
for any number of reasons.

232
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,942
I was ready to step up,

233
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:25,893
and the deal was cut long ago
that he'd back me when the time came.

234
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,009
You and Tony--
You guys jumped the line.

235
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,378
It wasn't your turn.

236
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,052
First of all, I'm sorry if Tony
and I ruined your party plans,

237
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:37,560
but I wasn't privy to whatever
you and Clarence cooked up.

238
00:12:37,627 --> 00:12:39,050
That aside I was...

239
00:12:39,445 --> 00:12:41,895
kind of looking forward
to working closely together.

240
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:44,235
I think that we could
make things happen.

241
00:12:46,003 --> 00:12:47,937
You're only getting
the one term, Tommy.

242
00:12:48,043 --> 00:12:49,641
I'm not gonna stand down next time.

243
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,862
What makes you think
I'll even be around that long?

244
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:53,475
Governor's race is in two years,

245
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:55,212
and plans can change.

246
00:12:55,596 --> 00:12:59,453
You find yourself mayor in 2008
without so much as a campaign speech.

247
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:15,498
Wasn't easy to track you down.

248
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:18,098
None of the numbers I got
for you don't work no more.

249
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:19,566
I see you got a problem.

250
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,053
Looking rough, Bubs.

251
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:23,654
I been keeping it clean, you know...

252
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,196
pushing my carts and all.

253
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:27,600
But this one young man--
every time I cross him,

254
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,400
I get tossed
for what I got on me.

255
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,117
Cash, pills.

256
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:34,333
I mean, he look on me like
an ATM or some shit. I swear.

257
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:36,385
I'm ready to work, Kima.

258
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,577
Get this motherfucker off me,
I'll do what you need.

259
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,537
Look at me, Bubs.
I ain't a narco.

260
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:41,748
Yeah, I see.

261
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:42,935
You look nice.

262
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:44,278
I'm working homicides.

263
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,636
So, if the bad boy happen to kill me,
you can help me out then, right?

264
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:54,861
If we drive around a bit, you think
you can put eyes on this motherfucker?

265
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,703
I can try.

266
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,315
So, Narice is bucking already.

267
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:04,803
Feels like if the mayor's chair

268
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:06,672
ain't gonna go to Royce,
it should be hers.

269
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:08,338
Problem is she's gonna see any proposal

270
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:11,071
to raise the commissioner's salary
as a move against Burrell.

271
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,162
Which it is.

272
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:15,114
We can't raise the salary, we can't
attract strong minority candidates.

273
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:17,936
No strong candidates, we can't get rid
of the guy we got.

274
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:20,905
Fuck if I'm gonna live with
Burrell as my commissioner.

275
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:22,874
What if he quits?

276
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:25,199
- Quits?
- Maybe the man can be shamed.

277
00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:26,886
If he leaves on his own account,

278
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:29,705
that takes us off the hook
with Narice and the ministers.

279
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:30,949
Right?

280
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,608
No. I mean, we don't want
your credit card number.

281
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:36,266
I mean, we won't
even know the number.

282
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:38,482
We just need you
to order the candy.

283
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:40,543
And you have cash up front?

284
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:42,609
He pay you back, Mr. P,
when he sell off, man.

285
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:43,643
He gonna pay you back.

286
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:47,079
Points on the package, huh?

287
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:49,542
- No way.
- Aw, come on, Mr. Pryzbo.

288
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:52,914
I mean, doesn't it teach us
math, addition, subtraction,

289
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:57,059
a quarter, a 1/4 of a dollar,
a dime, 1/10, you know?

290
00:14:57,678 --> 00:14:58,915
No cash, no card.

291
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:02,582
All right. Fine.

292
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,528
Cash up front.

293
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:06,022
No problem.

294
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:09,985
And if you come in
with a wad of bills tomorrow, Randy,

295
00:15:10,504 --> 00:15:11,946
I want to know where they came from.

296
00:15:12,013 --> 00:15:14,037
I don't want either
of you out on the corner.

297
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,313
All right.

298
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:19,961
Ms. Decent, you OK?

299
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:22,265
I, uh...

300
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:24,761
I think my car's been stolen.

301
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:32,965
Yeah, man. All right.

302
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:35,223
So, what I'm saying
is that you got from

303
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:37,585
Bentlow down there
to Rosewood right here.

304
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:38,882
All right?

305
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:41,338
Now, I got the block from Monroe
all the way down to Pacer,

306
00:15:41,377 --> 00:15:44,315
so you're covered that side, but
you gotta put lookouts in Franklintown

307
00:15:44,355 --> 00:15:46,121
to catch anybody coming
from the other way.

308
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,176
- All right, I got you.
- Are you ready to work?

309
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:50,949
Yeah, just my read up
and go on about the shit for real.

310
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:52,418
No, are you ready to work?

311
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:54,621
Ready to work.

312
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:58,792
- Hey, Donut, go talk to little Kevin.
- All right.

313
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:00,371
Hey, yo, look.

314
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,707
Man, please do not be having
your mama come talk for you.

315
00:16:03,952 --> 00:16:05,628
Man, I ain't have her do nothing.

316
00:16:05,754 --> 00:16:07,612
She just get on her horse
and come with it.

317
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:09,923
Look. I done did everything
I can for you and yours,

318
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:13,312
but from here on, your moms
can't do nothing to help.

319
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:15,149
All right?

320
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:20,188
Him?

321
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:21,559
From Wee-Bey?

322
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:24,277
Your mom's?

323
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,956
No sign of the motherfucker Andre.

324
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:39,304
Store been padlocked a week.

325
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,157
Ain't even calling for his re-up.

326
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:46,267
Check the man at the jail?

327
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:50,692
People say Omar ain't even been
on the tier for two weeks,

328
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:52,234
so he either staying someplace

329
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,124
or they got him at county lockup.

330
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:56,327
Or the charges been dropped.

331
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,526
If this cocksucker's sprung,

332
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,692
my man is backing up on his story.

333
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,095
Mean he could back up on y'all.

334
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,434
I'm on it.

335
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:12,691
How about the New York boys?

336
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:14,128
We dropped 5 of them.

337
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:15,861
Pushed them into the ground.

338
00:17:16,392 --> 00:17:17,615
Drive through east Baltimore,

339
00:17:17,674 --> 00:17:20,417
you don't even see a Baltimore
nigger with a Yankee cap.

340
00:17:21,421 --> 00:17:23,000
Want us to stay on that, too?

341
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,521
I talked to the fat man,

342
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,760
but I think we're done there.

343
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:30,858
This shit with Andre...

344
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:32,476
job one.

345
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:46,163
No. We could try the avenue again.
Keep an eye on the market sometimes.

346
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,900
Look, Bubs, I ain't
got all fucking day.

347
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,033
I'm on shift work now.

348
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:50,276
I'm working murders.

349
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:52,099
He banked me 4 times this week, Kima.

350
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,529
I'm having dreams about
this low-bottom motherfucker.

351
00:17:54,588 --> 00:17:56,165
All right.
I tell you what.

352
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,452
You want to work?

353
00:17:57,592 --> 00:18:00,079
I'll call Sydnor or Herc
down at major crimes,

354
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:02,301
put you with someone
doing drug work.

355
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:05,196
You work for them,
they'll help you with your problem.

356
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,188
- All right?
- I need this now, Kima.

357
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:08,446
I'll tell them that.

358
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:09,502
Woman--

359
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:11,203
So, show me where you're living,

360
00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:13,296
and I'll tell them where
they can find you.

361
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,069
Make the left.

362
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:26,616
I don't understand.

363
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,238
You told the man
you not gonna kill no one.

364
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:32,677
I gave my word on that.

365
00:18:34,283 --> 00:18:36,206
Fuck we doing
back here then, papa?

366
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:38,592
I can still put a gun
in Andre's face, right?

367
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:42,172
That man got some explaining to do.

368
00:18:45,904 --> 00:18:47,444
It's dead out here, yo.

369
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:49,272
Tip on out.

370
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:02,409
I don't know why he don't
trust us with it, yo.

371
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:04,676
I mean, we trustworthy, ain't we?

372
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:08,309
Just gotta get enough
for the first order.

373
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,477
Then we're good.

374
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:16,866
...I get my money?

375
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:19,517
All right!
Hard 6!

376
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:21,044
Come on, treys!

377
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:24,424
I'm in.

378
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:25,879
Go away, boy.

379
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:30,261
- Oh, you in?
- Yeah.

380
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,622
Pass line for me, yo.

381
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:36,107
Oh, shit!

382
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:37,484
Yeah. Get that money.

383
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:39,043
Get that money, shorty.

384
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,431
Get that money.

385
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,114
I heard tell of it,
but I didn't believe it.

386
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:55,314
All this overtime,
all for two cases as a secondary.

387
00:19:55,749 --> 00:19:57,961
First names are red,
then they're green,

388
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,206
then they're black.

389
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,851
And that doesn't even include the court

390
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:03,169
pay you make if the soft
case goes to trial.

391
00:20:04,186 --> 00:20:05,453
- Sweet.
- So,

392
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,129
what you gonna do with yours,
detective Greggs, huh?

393
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:10,142
Pay down some debt.

394
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,883
Why you leaving?

395
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:21,387
Your luck ain't gonna change.

396
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:22,519
Don't worry about that now.

397
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:25,966
Yo, thanks for walking us off.
I thought we was gonna get banked.

398
00:20:26,816 --> 00:20:28,301
You ain't gonna bank us, is you?

399
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:29,612
Shit, boy.

400
00:20:29,753 --> 00:20:31,331
You think I'm that ungrateful?

401
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:33,265
I followed you
through 10 shooters

402
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,930
and made more money
that I have in a month.

403
00:20:37,338 --> 00:20:38,898
Nah. I ain't gonna rob you.

404
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,421
I just need to know next
time you fade a dice game.

405
00:20:41,564 --> 00:20:42,531
You feel?

406
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:45,680
I mean, it's all about the math,
you know, the probabilities and all.

407
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:47,713
I ain't never seen
you in a game before.

408
00:20:47,752 --> 00:20:49,055
Where you learn your game?

409
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:50,323
Edward Tillman Middle.

410
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:51,728
Shit.

411
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:53,894
All we got is Little Kevin.

412
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,829
Oh, Bodie's boy, huh?

413
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:59,110
What'd I tell you?
Bubs gets it the first time.

414
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,093
What are you doing?

415
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:05,319
Y'all meet up with me
in the afternoon tomorrow--

416
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:08,191
after school lets out--
and I'll give Kevin a new hat.

417
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:09,638
A hat trick?
Cool.

418
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:13,248
- Yo, Herc, man?
- What's up?

419
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:15,794
It's not about the money this time.

420
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,984
He breaking me every day
unless I give him something.

421
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,913
I can't-- I can't
take it anymore, man.

422
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:21,827
Once we're done with Kevin,

423
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:23,225
you go find this asshole.

424
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:24,615
Hit my cellphone.

425
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:26,851
I'll be on him 5 minutes later.

426
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:28,268
I promise.

427
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:36,878
Then you this, yo,
and watch it fizzle.

428
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:39,735
Not so much.
Not so much.

429
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:41,768
You gonna make it spill
everywhere, you see?

430
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:46,518
What are you still doing here?

431
00:21:46,578 --> 00:21:48,157
Ain't nobody want you here.

432
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,608
Your mama want me.

433
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:51,366
You and the pipe.

434
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:54,008
Shouldn't talk
about your mama like that.

435
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:55,892
Hey, daddy, see my volcano?

436
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:57,900
Bug, go upstairs.

437
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:00,598
Bug need me, too.

438
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,632
Saturday, right?

439
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,120
- Bug need me.
- My teachers say I gotta need glasses.

440
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:10,015
I gotta have an adult with me.

441
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:11,870
Pick 'em up.
Sign for 'em.

442
00:22:13,385 --> 00:22:15,102
Bug, go upstairs to your room.

443
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:20,288
Ice cold, boy.

444
00:22:21,062 --> 00:22:22,286
Where you be?

445
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:25,144
Ain't got a forgiveness to your soul.

446
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:27,196
Man, fuck you.

447
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,552
Watch your mouth.

448
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:31,962
You're big,
but not big enough.

449
00:22:33,536 --> 00:22:34,780
Now...

450
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:36,572
where's that D.S.S. Card?

451
00:22:36,682 --> 00:22:37,970
Your mama said that come to me.

452
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:40,236
Ain't nothing left
on this month's check anyway.

453
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:45,001
Before the first of the month, then.

454
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,857
Hey.

455
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:10,736
Hey.

456
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:12,574
Uh, come on in.

457
00:23:23,057 --> 00:23:25,800
I see the little man
done took over the living room.

458
00:23:26,058 --> 00:23:27,175
Good for him.

459
00:23:27,518 --> 00:23:28,920
You know how it goes.

460
00:23:29,063 --> 00:23:31,195
Well, I'm just messing with you.

461
00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:33,298
Place looks great.

462
00:23:33,502 --> 00:23:35,654
Even the toys look
like they belong.

463
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:37,902
B.

464
00:23:38,143 --> 00:23:39,210
This is...

465
00:23:39,277 --> 00:23:41,006
this month
and two going back.

466
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:43,077
I'm just trying to catch up.

467
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:45,665
I appreciate you not
coming after me for it.

468
00:23:46,244 --> 00:23:48,099
Knocking over liquor stores now?

469
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:50,136
Overtime from homicide.

470
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:54,832
It stays like this, and I won't have
problem coming up with my share.

471
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,588
Kima, this ain't--

472
00:23:56,646 --> 00:23:57,969
Please take me back.

473
00:23:58,129 --> 00:23:59,479
But a deal's a deal.

474
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,924
Right?

475
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:04,199
Hey, I'm home.

476
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,350
Hey, Elijah.

477
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:08,685
Hey.

478
00:24:09,922 --> 00:24:11,965
Kima, this is Nancy Owens.

479
00:24:13,002 --> 00:24:14,570
Sorry.
The place is a mess.

480
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:16,836
You could stay for dinner,

481
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:19,580
but tonight we have
people coming over.

482
00:24:20,818 --> 00:24:22,531
It's a kind of
a celebration actually.

483
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:24,633
I passed the bar this week.

484
00:24:25,624 --> 00:24:26,808
Congratulations.

485
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:29,674
Most of the guys I work
with have a problem with that.

486
00:24:29,917 --> 00:24:31,595
- With what?
- Passing the bar.

487
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:36,612
Well, guess I better be going.

488
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:39,016
Thanks for coming past.

489
00:24:39,265 --> 00:24:41,111
- Let's make bed...
- yeah.

490
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:42,571
Nice meeting you.

491
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:44,030
Elijah?

492
00:24:44,594 --> 00:24:45,752
Say bye to aunt Kima.

493
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:46,819
Bye.

494
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:13,585
- Where's Dre?
- I don't know!

495
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:14,828
- You believe her?
- No.

496
00:25:19,055 --> 00:25:21,213
One last time.
Where's Andre?

497
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:24,457
He said if he told me
where he was going,

498
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:25,982
I'd have to tell you, too.

499
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:27,807
I don't know.

500
00:25:27,846 --> 00:25:30,076
- I don't know.
- You believe her now?

501
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:43,651
Dang.
Sure is quiet this early.

502
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,558
Yo, you gonna come
with me to see Mr. P?

503
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,032
No. Go on up.
I'll sit in home room.

504
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,197
All right.

505
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,973
Mr. P.

506
00:25:58,285 --> 00:25:59,469
Randy.

507
00:26:00,661 --> 00:26:02,897
- Randy, how did you--
- 6 beats 4 or 5.

508
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,504
And most times 8 is better than 10.
Right?

509
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:07,013
You schooled me good.

510
00:26:07,072 --> 00:26:09,355
- You gambled for this?
- I ain't even pick up the dice.

511
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:11,150
I was all pass, no pass.

512
00:26:11,189 --> 00:26:13,735
Got to the point where some of them
was following me in there.

513
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:14,664
You shouldn't gamble.

514
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:16,017
I know, but I'm just saying.

515
00:26:16,135 --> 00:26:17,694
The math be right, Mr. P.,

516
00:26:18,485 --> 00:26:19,719
I'm gonna come back at lunch,

517
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:21,845
and we can computer up that candy.
All right?

518
00:26:21,992 --> 00:26:23,064
Peace.

519
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,816
Resign?

520
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:32,165
Either that or the day-to-day
running of the department

521
00:26:32,263 --> 00:26:34,908
falls to the deputy commissioner
for operations.

522
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:39,608
Erv, I have made no secret
of wanting to make changes.

523
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:43,378
Oh, so Bill Rawls is now
the voice of reform, is he?

524
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,834
This isn't about Rawls.

525
00:26:44,913 --> 00:26:47,222
I have no faith in you,
given recent events.

526
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:50,034
And I know you remember the two
of us sitting in this same booth

527
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:53,275
a year ago, you telling me about
how you respect the chain of command.

528
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:54,873
Well, respect it now.

529
00:26:54,952 --> 00:26:58,585
Every department head serves
at the pleasure of the mayor.

530
00:26:58,763 --> 00:27:01,684
So, if you're firing me,
Mr. Mayor,

531
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:04,580
I want you to know
I will go quietly.

532
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,636
You'll tender your
letter of resignation?

533
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:08,028
Oh, no.

534
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:09,686
I'm not offering to resign.

535
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:13,397
If you want me to go,
you're gonna have to shit-can me.

536
00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:15,963
A small distinction,
I know, but...

537
00:27:17,412 --> 00:27:18,833
in the meantime,

538
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:21,998
since you have Bill Rawls
doing my job for me

539
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:24,125
and it's such a nice day out,

540
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:27,614
I think I'll go
to forest park and shoot 9.

541
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,997
Check is yours, I think.

542
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,655
Pick a table, any table.

543
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:42,199
Eiffel tower, Big Ben,
empire state building.

544
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:43,880
Your table is your team.

545
00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:46,325
The team that puts its
model together first wins.

546
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:49,273
You say y'all can work
together out on the corner.

547
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,276
Let's see how you do on this.

548
00:27:51,342 --> 00:27:54,423
- With what?
- Big fat Gold stars and shit.

549
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:57,510
A dinner downtown.

550
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,472
Any restaurant you can agree on.

551
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:02,655
Since y'all only seem willing to be
interested in stuff you know,

552
00:28:02,812 --> 00:28:04,510
we look for things
more like Baltimore.

553
00:28:04,628 --> 00:28:06,945
The scale model
of the Fayette street stash house

554
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:08,277
was all sold out.

555
00:28:08,764 --> 00:28:10,745
So,
y'all just gonna have to make do.

556
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:13,774
Mr. Colvin, The box say there's supposed
to be some instructions.

557
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:14,903
We took those out.

558
00:28:14,948 --> 00:28:16,797
Makes it more interesting,
don't you think?

559
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:19,603
It ain't like we follow
instructions anywhere else, Right?

560
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:25,461
And I ain't gonna put
no charges on no one.

561
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,323
But see, they made me do that,

562
00:28:27,677 --> 00:28:30,525
and now they're gonna be mad
at me 'cause it ain't stick.

563
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:32,181
Who be they?

564
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,154
People I'm getting the package from.

565
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:35,545
I'm asking "who?"

566
00:28:36,777 --> 00:28:37,988
Boy named Marlo.

567
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:40,948
He's big on the west side.
You heard of him?

568
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:42,518
Vaguely recall the name.

569
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:45,807
So, I just need to chill for a while
till they remember how to forget.

570
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:48,849
So, now you come over east side
and expect me to hide you.

571
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:53,018
Why is it that every
Baltimore nigger think

572
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:55,417
that running the fuck away
means crossing downtown?

573
00:28:55,832 --> 00:28:58,771
Shit. You ought to be in New York
or Philly or some shit.

574
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:00,251
No. See, I know that.

575
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:02,734
It's just that I don't know
no one outside of B-more,

576
00:29:02,802 --> 00:29:04,237
and I was just hoping, let's say,

577
00:29:04,304 --> 00:29:06,951
trade out my store,
you could maybe, you know,

578
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,098
front me some cash, get me out of town
with people you know.

579
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,438
I mean, I come to the east side to you,

580
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:15,392
but to me, west-side motherfuckers
are with Marlo.

581
00:29:17,673 --> 00:29:20,409
You know what the problem
with these here machines?

582
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,604
They too cheap to begin with.

583
00:29:22,689 --> 00:29:24,909
Some people would think
for what it's worth to fix it

584
00:29:24,954 --> 00:29:26,681
and make the shit work right,

585
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:30,030
you might as well dump
them and get another.

586
00:29:34,431 --> 00:29:36,119
2,000 and a free ride north

587
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:37,839
for the store and its contents.

588
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:39,477
Store worth way more, Joe.

589
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:41,209
It depends, don't it?

590
00:29:49,491 --> 00:29:52,034
No, it's goes
on the other side and shit.

591
00:29:56,233 --> 00:29:58,383
Stop fucking fronting me.
I want to do something.

592
00:29:58,444 --> 00:30:00,158
You curse at me again,
I'm gonna cut you.

593
00:30:00,203 --> 00:30:01,325
Get that shit out my face.

594
00:30:01,392 --> 00:30:03,115
I don't even want
to do this shit no more.

595
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,662
That's how you always do it.

596
00:30:05,393 --> 00:30:07,160
What are you doing?
Look at the box.

597
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:09,744
- Do that look like that's on the box?
- I can't do this.

598
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:12,619
Nigger, come on, now.
I'm trying to eat.

599
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:15,308
- Hey, give me that piece, yo.
- Fuck you, yo,

600
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,900
you don't even know what you're doing.

601
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:19,294
Just sit there and shut up
because you just don't know.

602
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:21,459
Come over here
and make me shut up, then.

603
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,047
You starting to piss me off,
you don't know what you're doing.

604
00:30:24,092 --> 00:30:25,168
You're too stupid.

605
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:27,187
Hey, Z, you do the top
while I do the middle.

606
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,484
Darnell, you got the leg parts.
All right?

607
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:30,965
Then you get it.

608
00:30:32,408 --> 00:30:33,910
Like that. Like that.

609
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,060
Shit!

610
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:10,227
Done.

611
00:31:10,317 --> 00:31:11,701
Aw, that's bullshit.

612
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,585
Man, you cheat.

613
00:31:14,697 --> 00:31:16,268
Go ahead and touch it, baby.

614
00:31:16,366 --> 00:31:17,802
That shit built to last.

615
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:19,484
What about the extra pieces?

616
00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:21,340
What extra pieces?

617
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:27,406
What's in your pocket?

618
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,687
Ain't nothing in my pocket.

619
00:31:30,947 --> 00:31:33,571
So, who cook a good
steak around here?

620
00:31:34,623 --> 00:31:36,059
I got a t-Bone right here.

621
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:40,500
- Check his ass out.
- I ain't even gonna...

622
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:44,103
One,
from the day of my inauguration,

623
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,457
Commissioner Burrell is to undertake no
initiative without clearing it with you.

624
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:49,233
Day-to-day administrative
responsibilities

625
00:31:49,323 --> 00:31:52,001
are to reside with the deputy office
if they don't already.

626
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,850
I like that. No problem.

627
00:31:53,895 --> 00:31:56,807
- Two, I need to elevate Stan Valchek.
- Good man Valchek.

628
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:58,933
He's a hack,
but he's my hack, and I owe him.

629
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:00,307
if I make him deputy for adman,

630
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:01,574
can he cause any real damage?

631
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,129
I'll watch over him.
No problem.

632
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:05,915
3, I'm bumping Daniels
from western command to Colonel,

633
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,875
Giving him C.I.D. and carte blanche
to fix the investigative units.

634
00:32:08,942 --> 00:32:10,685
- Cedric Daniels?
- Problem?

635
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:12,974
No, he's good police.

636
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:14,909
He's just got...

637
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:16,733
a little independent streak.

638
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,953
Independent from who?

639
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:22,086
I got no problem making Daniels.

640
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:25,056
- What else do you need?
- That's it for now.

641
00:32:26,206 --> 00:32:28,046
Mr. Mayor, about Ervin.

642
00:32:28,893 --> 00:32:30,210
If you don't mind my asking,

643
00:32:30,277 --> 00:32:33,296
why keep him as a puppet commissioner
when you can just fire the guy?

644
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:38,907
We mind you asking.

645
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:51,823
I'm partial to them cherries.

646
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:56,280
Yo, Dukie.

647
00:32:57,364 --> 00:32:59,674
You ever called social
services on your mother?

648
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:00,856
What?

649
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:03,595
I don't know.
I just want to know what happens

650
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,300
if you call social
services on somebody.

651
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:07,016
You want to report your mother?

652
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:09,769
She brung someone home,
and he won't leave.

653
00:33:10,258 --> 00:33:11,940
You don't want to call social services.

654
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,584
They get to looking
at your things,

655
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,383
they gonna put you in a group home,

656
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,951
split you and bug up even.

657
00:33:18,318 --> 00:33:21,256
But I don't want us to leave.
I just want him to leave.

658
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,542
Talking about bug's daddy, ain't you?

659
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:25,595
Maybe I ought to talk
to a teacher about this.

660
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:28,258
Mr. Pryzbo is real good about stuff.

661
00:33:29,326 --> 00:33:32,152
Mr. P. Did say I could go talk
to the school social worker.

662
00:33:32,197 --> 00:33:33,543
Mr. Rotten neck?

663
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:34,929
He an alcoholic.

664
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:36,851
What about that boxing guy?

665
00:33:37,153 --> 00:33:38,365
Mr. Cutty?

666
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:40,746
What's wrong with Cutty?

667
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,539
I don't know.

668
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,358
Like, he just
too friendly, you know.

669
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,862
That shit creep me out, man.

670
00:33:49,744 --> 00:33:51,606
Like, he some type
of faggot or something.

671
00:33:51,673 --> 00:33:52,884
Nah, not Cutty, man.

672
00:33:53,093 --> 00:33:54,910
He be all up in the women.

673
00:33:55,078 --> 00:33:56,603
Yo, don't you see how he be doing?

674
00:33:56,648 --> 00:33:57,859
That don't mean shit.

675
00:33:57,904 --> 00:33:59,990
Them faggots
will be just like that, too.

676
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,556
And I don't know.
He just too friendly, you know.

677
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,604
Everybody just too
motherfucking friendly.

678
00:34:10,121 --> 00:34:11,938
Je ne sais quoi right there.

679
00:34:13,037 --> 00:34:15,121
That's my man Poot.
That's his style. Look at that!

680
00:34:15,557 --> 00:34:16,892
He goes right to the dark.

681
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:18,458
Now, see, this is more me.

682
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:21,025
It's more me.
Spin around, punch it.

683
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,539
They're fucking me.

684
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,308
So, his name is--
What'd you call him?

685
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,508
Looks like a joke.

686
00:34:28,671 --> 00:34:30,354
Yeah. They flip 'em.

687
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:33,760
A bunch of fucking clowns.

688
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:41,072
Last year we had M.S.A.S
in the 22 percentile.

689
00:34:41,895 --> 00:34:43,731
And don't think they
haven't noticed it

690
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:45,570
down at the puzzle palace.

691
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:49,662
The word is they're looking
for at least a 10-Point increase

692
00:34:49,729 --> 00:34:52,561
from all city middle
schools this time around.

693
00:34:53,078 --> 00:34:55,012
We're still 6 weeks away
from the M.S.A.S

694
00:34:55,057 --> 00:34:56,997
and you want us to start
teaching the test now?

695
00:34:57,064 --> 00:35:01,377
This year, the preferred term
is curriculum alignment.

696
00:35:02,094 --> 00:35:04,431
There's nothing wrong
with emphasizing the skills

697
00:35:04,497 --> 00:35:06,304
necessary for the M.S.A.

698
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:08,130
If we can get them
to write a paragraph

699
00:35:08,197 --> 00:35:09,776
without a 4-letter word in it,

700
00:35:09,843 --> 00:35:12,207
it'll have to have better
command of English.

701
00:35:12,455 --> 00:35:14,022
Marcia,
skill sets are one thing,

702
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:16,130
but this has us teaching
test questions direct.

703
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,969
Test questions that involve skills.

704
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,144
- I don't see your point.
- You don't want to see it.

705
00:35:20,189 --> 00:35:22,639
Were you really expecting
something different than last year?

706
00:35:22,683 --> 00:35:25,509
I don't see the math section.
These are all language-arts questions.

707
00:35:25,553 --> 00:35:28,266
Our greatest failing
on standardized tests last year.

708
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:29,477
So, for the time being,

709
00:35:29,522 --> 00:35:31,534
all teachers will
devote class time

710
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:34,496
to teaching language-arts
sample questions.

711
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,564
Now, if you turn to page 11, please,

712
00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:40,829
I have some things
I want to go over with you.

713
00:35:40,897 --> 00:35:42,220
I don't get it.

714
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:45,293
All this so we score
higher on the state tests?

715
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:48,658
If we're teaching the kids
the test questions,

716
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:50,202
what is it assessing in them?

717
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:52,120
Nothing.
It assesses us.

718
00:35:52,188 --> 00:35:53,578
The test scores go up,

719
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:55,261
They can say the schools are improving.

720
00:35:55,305 --> 00:35:57,563
The scores stay down,
they can't.

721
00:35:57,742 --> 00:35:59,088
Juking the stats.

722
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:00,344
Excuse me?

723
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:03,257
Making robberies into larcenies.

724
00:36:03,325 --> 00:36:04,917
Making rapes disappear.

725
00:36:05,673 --> 00:36:08,903
You juke the stats,
and Majors become Colonels.

726
00:36:09,974 --> 00:36:11,255
I've been here before.

727
00:36:11,591 --> 00:36:14,283
Wherever you go,
there you are.

728
00:36:20,466 --> 00:36:22,395
Raven's got that dude Mike Anderson.

729
00:36:22,578 --> 00:36:23,924
He and Jamal gonna be running...

730
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:25,471
Look at these runts.

731
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:29,364
We're gonna go when that
football's in the air on a long pass.

732
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:30,999
- Slow?
- Yeah.

733
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:33,037
Big yellow right here.

734
00:36:34,074 --> 00:36:35,084
Yellows, yellows!

735
00:36:35,128 --> 00:36:36,586
Go long. Go. Go.

736
00:36:36,646 --> 00:36:37,745
Throw it high.

737
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,063
Big yellow.

738
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,396
Go.

739
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,943
- Narco!
- Oh, shit.

740
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,876
Po-Po, yo! Po-Po!

741
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,605
- Where you going?
- Put me down!

742
00:36:53,627 --> 00:36:54,995
They're in the alleys.

743
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:56,918
We get back in there,
we can hunt them up.

744
00:36:56,985 --> 00:36:58,934
No need.
I know 'em all.

745
00:36:58,979 --> 00:37:01,131
- Let me go motherfucker.
- What about this one?

746
00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:03,471
He isn't even bait.
We toss him back--

747
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:06,224
unless we want to spend half the shift
down at baby booking.

748
00:37:06,262 --> 00:37:08,211
- Me?
- I ain't afraid, motherfucker.

749
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:10,747
I don't want to spend the
shift on evidence control.

750
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,097
Then why the fuck even do this?

751
00:37:12,164 --> 00:37:13,353
So's I can talk to them.

752
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,044
I like to think that until
the handcuffs actually fit,

753
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:17,612
there's still talking to be done.

754
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:19,698
Come here, man.
Let's take a walk.

755
00:37:19,964 --> 00:37:21,490
You shut the fuck up.

756
00:37:24,915 --> 00:37:26,485
Yo, who you listening to?

757
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,179
Miss lady day.

758
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:29,959
Billie Holliday.

759
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,475
Yeah, she sounds good.

760
00:37:31,561 --> 00:37:33,333
You know, real sad, kind of.

761
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:36,879
Yeah. I'm like that.

762
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,993
You be thinking I'm all ghetto,
and then I flip it

763
00:37:39,061 --> 00:37:40,474
and mess your mind all up.

764
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:43,085
The next time we do this, Mr. Colvin,

765
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:45,695
could you please
make it on the weekend?

766
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:47,551
I only had, like, 3 hours

767
00:37:47,618 --> 00:37:49,151
between school
and now to get ready.

768
00:37:49,196 --> 00:37:50,631
You look fine, Zenolia.

769
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:51,928
I could look better.

770
00:37:51,972 --> 00:37:54,395
How long you think it take
to do hair like this?

771
00:37:54,485 --> 00:37:56,285
I'm ordering the biggest
quarter pounder.

772
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:58,835
- Fries, too.
- Nigger, this ain't Mickey D's.

773
00:37:58,933 --> 00:38:01,467
You better be thinking
t-bone steak medium rare.

774
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:02,679
The blood all squirting out?

775
00:38:02,723 --> 00:38:04,047
Nah, ain't no blood.

776
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:07,187
What you think rare is?
It mean rarely cooked, hardly cooked.

777
00:38:07,516 --> 00:38:09,821
Rare.
Get the blood out, stupid.

778
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,739
- See?
- And medium rare, keep the blood in.

779
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:13,870
All right. Look.

780
00:38:13,915 --> 00:38:17,227
All I want to know which is which
before I order some undone meat.

781
00:38:17,355 --> 00:38:18,540
Hey, Mr. Colvin.

782
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:20,112
How it work?

783
00:38:20,157 --> 00:38:22,304
Look, we're just gonna ask the waiter.
All right.

784
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:23,942
Oh, shit. There's a waiter?

785
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,758
Just right down the block.

786
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:29,246
- Where she at, dawg?
- Ain't seen her.

787
00:38:30,123 --> 00:38:32,070
She owe me.
All that shit I gave her.

788
00:38:36,683 --> 00:38:37,961
How you not know?

789
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:39,384
I don't know.

790
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:42,016
She let me find her,
I'm gonna cut her titty off. Watch.

791
00:38:43,193 --> 00:38:44,741
You got something
to say, nigger?

792
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:47,290
Yo, where Herc at?

793
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:49,845
I got the asshole, OK.

794
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:51,584
Tell him Riggs and Calhoun.

795
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:53,934
He knows. He knows.

796
00:39:00,759 --> 00:39:01,992
Get the fuck back here.

797
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,652
Nigger, I will fuck you up.

798
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:05,912
You don't know Lex?

799
00:39:06,642 --> 00:39:07,764
I knew the bull.

800
00:39:07,915 --> 00:39:09,485
I mean, I know him.

801
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,445
But he ain't been around though.

802
00:39:11,512 --> 00:39:13,656
You see? Right there.
You just fucked up.

803
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:15,697
You said you knew him
like you knew he was dead.

804
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,967
No. Now you putting
words in my mouth.

805
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:19,806
I meant knew him.

806
00:39:20,196 --> 00:39:22,922
When he was around,
I knew him, but he left.

807
00:39:23,371 --> 00:39:24,470
Herc.

808
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:32,676
Bubbles called.
He sees the guy-- the asshole.

809
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:33,962
He's on Riggs and Calhoun.

810
00:39:34,051 --> 00:39:36,698
Says he'll hold him there
5 minutes for you to get across town.

811
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:38,560
I'm in the middle
of an interview here.

812
00:39:38,605 --> 00:39:39,861
What the fuck?

813
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,867
Tell him we'll fix
his problem tomorrow.

814
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:44,459
All right?

815
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:48,879
Oh, motherfucker.

816
00:39:49,531 --> 00:39:50,855
He ain't got a phone.

817
00:39:51,483 --> 00:39:54,566
You lied to me out on the street.
Why should I believe you now?

818
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,845
You was there
when Lex got killed.

819
00:39:58,019 --> 00:39:59,611
You part of the fucking setup.

820
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:02,886
We know 'cause we have a witness
who put you right in there.

821
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:04,495
Yeah, we do.

822
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:06,534
You know right
where that body is.

823
00:40:08,466 --> 00:40:09,856
You were there with Snoop,

824
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,903
Chris, whoever else.

825
00:40:15,548 --> 00:40:17,432
Know how to make
an interrogation work?

826
00:40:18,905 --> 00:40:20,139
Leverage.

827
00:40:20,606 --> 00:40:22,064
You don't have leverage?

828
00:40:22,311 --> 00:40:23,971
Motherfucker,
you don't even got a body.

829
00:40:24,015 --> 00:40:25,899
Lex is nothing but a name in there.

830
00:40:29,554 --> 00:40:31,236
Where the fuck
you think you're going?

831
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,178
Home depot here!

832
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:44,762
What you got for me tonight?

833
00:40:44,784 --> 00:40:46,479
I've been listening
all day long, Dawg.

834
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:48,251
No. We done with this right here.

835
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:50,674
Say what? Don't play, man.
I ain't got time for your shit.

836
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,099
My shit's all you're gonna get.

837
00:40:52,143 --> 00:40:54,543
You can kiss my ass all
the fucking trouble you give me.

838
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,603
What you looking for?
It's not there. It's on me, all right.

839
00:41:00,676 --> 00:41:02,107
- It's on you?
- Yeah.

840
00:41:02,564 --> 00:41:05,110
- It's on you?!
- Wait, wait!

841
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:12,006
Get off me! Get off me!

842
00:41:15,978 --> 00:41:18,254
Hey, wait, wait!
You take him! Take him!

843
00:41:18,338 --> 00:41:20,132
- I got you now!
- No, no!

844
00:41:22,297 --> 00:41:23,441
Like that?!

845
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:24,946
Fucker!

846
00:41:25,013 --> 00:41:26,013
Easy!

847
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:41,915
I don't like the orange ones.

848
00:41:42,095 --> 00:41:43,351
Listen to me, fuckhead.

849
00:41:43,395 --> 00:41:44,696
We know you were there.

850
00:41:44,801 --> 00:41:46,057
We know you set him up,

851
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:47,986
and we know you didn't do it alone.

852
00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:49,242
Say what?

853
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:51,473
You weren't alone in this.
We know that.

854
00:41:52,662 --> 00:41:53,940
You mean Randy?

855
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:00,192
I'm asking you questions, remember?

856
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,450
If you don't give us
this murder, Kevin,

857
00:42:02,485 --> 00:42:04,302
somebody else will,
and when they do,

858
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,334
they'll be putting you in.
You hear me?

859
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,733
Colvin, party of 4.

860
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,279
I'll make sure your table's ready.

861
00:42:24,322 --> 00:42:25,780
Colvin, party of 4, huh?

862
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:28,806
Hi. May I take your coat?

863
00:42:29,475 --> 00:42:30,776
Sure.

864
00:42:31,504 --> 00:42:32,558
You, sir?

865
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,061
Oh, no.
I'm good.

866
00:42:34,616 --> 00:42:36,052
Yeah. Me, too.

867
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:39,650
OK. Your table's ready.

868
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:41,855
Follow me, please.

869
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:02,386
Sir?

870
00:43:02,658 --> 00:43:03,674
That's your chair, right?

871
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:04,818
No.

872
00:43:04,936 --> 00:43:05,968
You sit there.

873
00:43:07,892 --> 00:43:09,673
The waitress will be here soon

874
00:43:10,246 --> 00:43:12,287
to detail the specials of the day.

875
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,043
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

876
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,357
Waitress?

877
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:17,501
Who was that?

878
00:43:17,613 --> 00:43:18,936
That's the, uh, hostess.

879
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:20,459
Hey, you ain't gotta worry, Mr. C.

880
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:23,535
I ain't gonna run up your Bill.
I'll just get whatever's on special.

881
00:43:23,804 --> 00:43:26,734
It ain't no k-mart
blue-light special, dumb-ass.

882
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,532
Special just mean
they cook something different.

883
00:43:30,728 --> 00:43:33,188
Yo, what about you,
drinking without a straw,

884
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:34,287
all ghetto and shit?

885
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:36,384
You don't drink water with a straw.

886
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,784
And put that on your lap, fool.

887
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:42,272
You see anybody else up in here
looking all Fred Flintstone and shit?

888
00:43:44,766 --> 00:43:47,387
Shut it down.
Other people be looking at us.

889
00:43:48,797 --> 00:43:50,448
Hello. My name is Ann.

890
00:43:50,516 --> 00:43:53,275
I'd like to tell you about
our specials for the day.

891
00:43:53,322 --> 00:43:56,036
We have king salmon
with sweet corn,

892
00:43:56,081 --> 00:43:58,404
chanterelles, and basil ravioli;

893
00:43:58,718 --> 00:44:02,570
sauted free-range chicken
served with mashed potatoes;

894
00:44:02,727 --> 00:44:06,915
fresh Chesapeake bay blue crab,
roasted garlic, shallot cream,

895
00:44:06,982 --> 00:44:08,777
and hen of the woods mushrooms;

896
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:11,100
and wood oven-roasted quail

897
00:44:11,243 --> 00:44:13,643
with grilled sapling bread salad.

898
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:15,774
Dang, I thought y'all had steak.

899
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:18,345
Oh, we do...
on the second page of your menus.

900
00:44:20,481 --> 00:44:22,118
May I get your drink orders?

901
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:29,816
We'll take 4 cokes, please.

902
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:31,714
- Right away.
- Thank you.

903
00:44:47,704 --> 00:44:49,640
Do you mind
if I come tomorrow?

904
00:44:52,965 --> 00:44:54,288
Mind?

905
00:44:54,468 --> 00:44:55,679
I--

906
00:44:58,191 --> 00:44:59,503
You wouldn't be embarrassed?

907
00:44:59,637 --> 00:45:01,185
No, not at all.

908
00:45:05,507 --> 00:45:06,695
I mean...

909
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:10,300
I'll be proud of you there.

910
00:45:13,612 --> 00:45:15,249
It's funny how it works out.

911
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:17,977
All those years I'm trying
to climb the ladder,

912
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:21,615
kissing ass, covering ass,
doing what I'm told.

913
00:45:21,978 --> 00:45:24,488
I finally let some of it out,
tell him what I really think,

914
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,260
and I'm going from
Lieutenant to Colonel

915
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:27,553
in a little more than a year.

916
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,196
And, you, you're worried sick
about those subpoenas

917
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:34,243
and worried that Lester
is killing me as a boss.

918
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:36,380
But the subpoenas
get me promoted.

919
00:45:38,744 --> 00:45:40,148
I know.

920
00:45:41,987 --> 00:45:43,467
You know, Marlo once said to me,

921
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:45,621
"You cannot lose if you do not play,"

922
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,146
but here we are, right?

923
00:45:58,064 --> 00:45:59,263
Maybe it's changing.

924
00:45:59,945 --> 00:46:01,179
What is?

925
00:46:02,252 --> 00:46:05,235
The city,
the way things work or don't.

926
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:09,653
Maybe we're turning a corner here

927
00:46:09,698 --> 00:46:12,149
that's not gonna be so
unbelievably fucked up anymore.

928
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:16,154
To Carcetti.

929
00:46:17,543 --> 00:46:18,732
And us.

930
00:46:25,089 --> 00:46:26,233
Zenolia,

931
00:46:26,654 --> 00:46:28,169
want to take a picture of restaurant?

932
00:46:28,237 --> 00:46:29,350
That's OK. It's late.

933
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:31,302
No. That's fine.
Come on. Give me the camera.

934
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:32,625
I'm OK.

935
00:46:32,692 --> 00:46:34,240
Come on, give me the camera.

936
00:46:35,484 --> 00:46:36,484
OK.

937
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,285
Don't want to be in the picture, right?

938
00:46:48,278 --> 00:46:51,037
Yo, Mr. C,
can we stop at McDonald's?

939
00:46:51,396 --> 00:46:52,674
Fuck wrong with you, boy?

940
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:53,773
Food wasn't right.

941
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:55,007
Don't like fish.

942
00:46:55,553 --> 00:46:56,908
Why'd you order it, then?

943
00:46:56,997 --> 00:46:58,680
Yo, shut the fuck up.

944
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:09,613
- Turn it down, Namond.
- What?

945
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:11,205
Turn it down, Namond.

946
00:47:11,273 --> 00:47:13,102
Turn it up?
All right, you got it.

947
00:47:13,904 --> 00:47:16,080
Seriously, can we get
some fries at least?

948
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,695
Boy, you is pathetic.

949
00:47:18,188 --> 00:47:21,129
Just 'cause you a girl do not mean
I'm gonna fuck you all up.

950
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:22,266
You hear me?

951
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,162
Nigger, please.

952
00:47:24,554 --> 00:47:27,598
- You keep talking all of that shit.
- No, you keep talking all that shit.

953
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:29,580
- Must have forgot.
- No, I ain't forget shit.

954
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:31,549
- What I forget anyway?
- That I'm the man.

955
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:36,423
So,
what's the first thing we do

956
00:47:36,585 --> 00:47:38,267
when we respond to a prompt?

957
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,179
Randy?

958
00:47:41,321 --> 00:47:42,644
According to the text?

959
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,191
According to the text.

960
00:47:46,628 --> 00:47:47,817
That's good.

961
00:47:48,164 --> 00:47:50,025
And how do we end the answer?

962
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:51,550
Quenice?

963
00:47:52,366 --> 00:47:54,138
Come on.
I know you know this.

964
00:47:58,801 --> 00:48:03,044
The above stated facts
have led me to conclude that.

965
00:48:03,408 --> 00:48:04,438
Right?

966
00:48:04,662 --> 00:48:07,040
OK. So, let's try to read
the third paragraph.

967
00:48:07,105 --> 00:48:08,294
I'll start it.

968
00:48:08,406 --> 00:48:11,487
Pythias makes a final plea
to the tyrant Dionysius

969
00:48:11,697 --> 00:48:15,785
to return to his home one last--
Calvin, pick it up.

970
00:48:16,597 --> 00:48:18,483
To return to his home one last time

971
00:48:18,573 --> 00:48:19,874
before his punishment.

972
00:48:20,301 --> 00:48:23,149
He denies the request
until Damon inter...

973
00:48:25,306 --> 00:48:26,652
intercedes.

974
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,930
And offers his own life
until Pythias returns.

975
00:48:32,221 --> 00:48:33,410
Good.

976
00:48:34,106 --> 00:48:36,238
Who wants to guess
what "intercedes" means?

977
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:45,650
What about "plea"?

978
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:51,670
OK.
What about the story, then?

979
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:54,160
How would you summarize it?

980
00:48:55,326 --> 00:48:57,854
Duquan, give it a shot.

981
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,052
According to the text.

982
00:49:00,388 --> 00:49:02,276
Everybody's safe in the end, right?

983
00:49:06,352 --> 00:49:08,685
Let's think this through.
According to the text,

984
00:49:08,976 --> 00:49:12,059
Damon offers his own life
on behalf of Pythias

985
00:49:12,104 --> 00:49:14,100
so that he can return home
one last time.

986
00:49:14,145 --> 00:49:16,931
The above-stated facts
have led me to conclude

987
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:20,807
that Damon values Pythias'
friendship and loyalty.

988
00:49:24,892 --> 00:49:26,238
Any questions?

989
00:49:30,073 --> 00:49:31,621
We got 4 of them raw.

990
00:49:32,544 --> 00:49:34,519
275 large right there.

991
00:49:35,214 --> 00:49:36,762
For 4, it should be 3.

992
00:49:36,942 --> 00:49:39,005
I'm charging 5 a head
on them new York boys--

993
00:49:39,274 --> 00:49:40,629
that about the going rate.

994
00:49:40,718 --> 00:49:42,019
Still want us on that?

995
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:43,151
Nah.

996
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,528
Seems like they got the message
and went the fuck on.

997
00:49:45,563 --> 00:49:46,573
True that.

998
00:49:46,595 --> 00:49:49,713
Delroy has all of the money
and street corners back.

999
00:49:49,758 --> 00:49:50,767
All right, then.

1000
00:49:50,812 --> 00:49:52,334
Holler at us for
the next package in.

1001
00:49:52,378 --> 00:49:55,339
You remember when I told
you about the co-op meant

1002
00:49:55,384 --> 00:49:56,909
we all stand together,

1003
00:49:57,456 --> 00:50:00,189
doing for each other when we can?
You remember that?

1004
00:50:01,479 --> 00:50:03,991
Well, the price of 4 raw is 300.

1005
00:50:05,778 --> 00:50:07,410
And your work on them
New York boys

1006
00:50:07,478 --> 00:50:09,631
already been factored
into the price, you see.

1007
00:50:09,836 --> 00:50:11,047
On the other hand,

1008
00:50:11,114 --> 00:50:13,976
we got something that you want,
and it's coming back to you...

1009
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:15,345
free of charge.

1010
00:50:15,457 --> 00:50:17,024
Someone you looking for.

1011
00:50:18,258 --> 00:50:20,299
Co-Op mean
what it sound like, Dawg.

1012
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,461
You happy to do for me,
I'm happy to do for you.

1013
00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:27,108
Congratulations.

1014
00:50:27,198 --> 00:50:28,425
Colonel.

1015
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,284
Congratulations.

1016
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:31,989
Deputy commissioner.

1017
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:35,151
Congratulations to all
those who were promoted,

1018
00:50:35,174 --> 00:50:36,738
their families, and friends.

1019
00:50:36,895 --> 00:50:38,376
It's a proud day for them

1020
00:50:38,488 --> 00:50:41,313
and a proud day
for the Baltimore police department.

1021
00:50:51,906 --> 00:50:53,017
I am so proud of you.

1022
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,143
You know, Valchek
we could have guessed.

1023
00:51:00,546 --> 00:51:03,026
I mean, he's Carcetti's man, but...

1024
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:05,718
Daniels?

1025
00:51:09,693 --> 00:51:11,129
Long time for you to make Major,

1026
00:51:11,174 --> 00:51:12,607
but this was quick enough.

1027
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,758
Yeah, who's your new rabbi, huh?

1028
00:51:15,684 --> 00:51:16,985
Colonel?

1029
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,259
So, they didn't know
the salad fork from

1030
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,776
whatever the fuck the other fork is for.
So what?

1031
00:51:21,866 --> 00:51:24,176
I knew they'd be at a loss,
but the extent of it.

1032
00:51:24,894 --> 00:51:26,472
I'm talking about feelings.

1033
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:28,580
Why they feeling this...

1034
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:32,138
this plummet from
Nassau university abject fear

1035
00:51:32,183 --> 00:51:34,110
to humiliated fury
and no awareness of it.

1036
00:51:34,155 --> 00:51:35,523
Who says they're not aware?

1037
00:51:35,568 --> 00:51:36,981
Maybe they just didn't acknowledge.

1038
00:51:37,026 --> 00:51:39,304
Either way, but my point is
where do you start with them?

1039
00:51:39,326 --> 00:51:40,753
How you get to believe in themselves

1040
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:42,152
if they can't admit their feelings

1041
00:51:42,197 --> 00:51:44,796
about who they are
and what they doing in this world?

1042
00:51:45,222 --> 00:51:46,591
They not fools.

1043
00:51:47,486 --> 00:51:49,797
They know exactly
what we expect them to be.

1044
00:51:50,537 --> 00:51:52,578
Y'all missed something else
for real though.

1045
00:51:52,623 --> 00:51:53,654
Take your seats.

1046
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:56,300
- It was hot, yo.
- Party of 4, Mr. Colvin.

1047
00:51:56,412 --> 00:51:58,206
May I take your coat,
Mr. Brice?

1048
00:51:58,296 --> 00:51:59,507
That shit was tight.

1049
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,992
I'm dreaming about
that chocolate cake.

1050
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:03,339
Oh, my God.

1051
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:05,960
Shit had like 56 layers, yo!

1052
00:52:07,043 --> 00:52:08,993
Try out people like Mr. Colvin...

1053
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,857
"D money saves pitman"?

1054
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,562
It's bullshit!

1055
00:52:25,196 --> 00:52:27,929
Before, at least they were
getting something out of it.

1056
00:52:29,692 --> 00:52:31,750
Hell with my evaluation.
To hell with Donnelly,

1057
00:52:31,795 --> 00:52:34,733
to hell with the statewide test scores.
I came here to teach.

1058
00:52:35,002 --> 00:52:36,124
Right?

1059
00:52:43,352 --> 00:52:45,505
Yo, coach, seen Michael?

1060
00:52:46,181 --> 00:52:47,721
- Nah.
- All right.

1061
00:52:49,631 --> 00:52:50,937
That wasn't you and your runts

1062
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:53,404
I saw down on Bentlow
yesterday slinging?

1063
00:52:53,854 --> 00:52:55,738
- Like this.
- Right.

1064
00:52:56,146 --> 00:52:59,264
'Cause a gangster like yourself
wouldn't set up such a weak-ass shop

1065
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:02,489
with no real lookouts,
ground stash in plain view.

1066
00:53:02,825 --> 00:53:04,687
This is me telling y'all
as plain as I can.

1067
00:53:04,754 --> 00:53:06,122
You guys had your one chance.

1068
00:53:06,145 --> 00:53:07,685
I see you out there a second time,

1069
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,287
everyone takes a beating
and goes to Cheltenham.

1070
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:11,992
Fair warning you just got.

1071
00:53:12,238 --> 00:53:14,160
Cheltenham for some drug charges?

1072
00:53:14,698 --> 00:53:16,974
- Please, man.
- I'll write you off as a special.

1073
00:53:17,266 --> 00:53:18,500
Don't think I won't do it.

1074
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:20,608
Jab, jab! Good.

1075
00:53:20,754 --> 00:53:22,212
He don't think I can jail?

1076
00:53:22,391 --> 00:53:24,298
Shit! I can jail.

1077
00:53:24,346 --> 00:53:26,399
- What's up?
- Man was banging, huh?

1078
00:53:27,506 --> 00:53:28,718
He's one of yours, right?

1079
00:53:28,763 --> 00:53:30,063
And he hang around the gym,

1080
00:53:30,108 --> 00:53:32,102
mostly waiting on his boy Michael.

1081
00:53:32,304 --> 00:53:33,717
He don't box or nothing.

1082
00:53:34,016 --> 00:53:35,564
He ain't that kind really.

1083
00:53:35,968 --> 00:53:38,182
- Not like his father.
- Yeah? Who was his father?

1084
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,371
Dude named Wee-Bey.

1085
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,591
Stone-Headed.
Used to run with them Barksdales.

1086
00:53:41,658 --> 00:53:42,802
I know him.

1087
00:53:42,901 --> 00:53:44,740
Shit, I locked him up
in Philadelphia.

1088
00:53:44,785 --> 00:53:45,862
Yeah?

1089
00:53:46,086 --> 00:53:47,432
Bey was my cut buddy.

1090
00:53:47,544 --> 00:53:49,063
We jailed down Jesse.

1091
00:53:50,723 --> 00:53:53,034
Anyway, Namond's from him.

1092
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,603
Same blood,
but not the same heart.

1093
00:53:56,881 --> 00:53:58,461
I've done my warm-ups, coach.

1094
00:53:58,595 --> 00:53:59,986
Yeah. We ready for the ring!

1095
00:54:00,323 --> 00:54:01,489
Take care, man.

1096
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,349
Why we stopping here?
I thought we was going straight out.

1097
00:54:12,775 --> 00:54:14,616
Gotta get with your escort out.

1098
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:17,038
Prop Joe said
you was my escort out.

1099
00:54:17,626 --> 00:54:19,622
Manner of speaking,
that be true.

1100
00:54:30,262 --> 00:54:31,630
Come on over here, man.

1101
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:33,738
Come on.

1102
00:54:37,453 --> 00:54:38,529
Chris, no.

1103
00:54:38,597 --> 00:54:39,965
You know I keep it quick, Dre.

1104
00:54:42,724 --> 00:54:44,267
- Here?
- Here's good.

1105
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:45,927
Not-- Not in a vacant.

1106
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,138
What's the difference?

1107
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:48,753
The difference is my people.

1108
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:49,987
They won't know.

1109
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:51,176
They'll know.

1110
00:54:51,624 --> 00:54:53,329
But-- But-- But the rats.

1111
00:54:53,396 --> 00:54:54,965
I'll be alone with the rats.

1112
00:54:55,145 --> 00:54:56,378
You're all right.

1113
00:54:56,759 --> 00:54:57,881
I got your back.

1114
00:54:57,904 --> 00:55:00,761
Come on, Chris.
Let me do it at my house so my people--

1115
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:02,219
they can give me a home go.

1116
00:55:08,698 --> 00:55:10,178
I'll be damned.

1117
00:55:11,783 --> 00:55:13,857
Hey, yo, that got to be Marlo, man.

1118
00:55:14,552 --> 00:55:15,696
You see?

1119
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:17,737
That's the man we robbed, yo,

1120
00:55:17,894 --> 00:55:19,172
from the poker game.

1121
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:23,374
Si. Si. Si.

1122
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,145
What the boy don't like me.

1123
00:55:27,501 --> 00:55:29,139
Boot you out of la vela.

1124
00:56:36,861 --> 00:56:38,753
Thought maybe
I could catch up with Chris.

1125
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:48,524
I got a problem
I can't bring to no one else.

1126
00:57:08,304 --> 00:57:09,448
Getting that?

1127
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,455
He just a kid.

1128
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:39,729
