1
00:00:09,607 --> 00:00:12,201
Yo, J, what up, son, where you been?

2
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:15,340
I ain't been nowhere, T.
Just laying low, man.

3
00:00:15,946 --> 00:00:18,278
Now watch, you gonna see
Darnell's little brother...

4
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:20,543
come on out with that laundry basket.

5
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:24,553
- And the take's in the basket?
- Once in the afternoon, and one at night.

6
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:26,953
Always the same laundry basket.

7
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:29,391
How you know?

8
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:32,189
That money got to come out somehow, man.

9
00:00:32,863 --> 00:00:35,127
So, we ain't got to blast our way
to the top floor.

10
00:00:35,232 --> 00:00:38,599
We just wait till they're in the street
with their shit.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,170
We gonna do them tonight, you heard?
After it get dark.

12
00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:50,574
Just like you say.

13
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:53,442
Put the basket down now, put it down!

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,917
- Fuck, I said put the basket down!
- Easy girl, chill.

15
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:59,182
You all niggers, you got caught slipping.

16
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,282
Sorry it had to go down like this, baby,
because your ass is cute.

17
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:04,020
But you got got.

18
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:06,094
Nice, very nice.

19
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:14,431
Bitches!

20
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:16,768
Now, that's something
you don't see every day.

21
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:16,448
No English.

22
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:22,991
Kunta Kinte...

23
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:25,759
yabba dabba dabba doo.

24
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:31,634
Mishy gishy gushy gushy
mishy meshy mushy, motherfucker.

25
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:37,981
Negro, you cannot travel
halfway around the world...

26
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:40,107
and not speak any motherfucking English.

27
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:44,945
English, motherfucker!

28
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:48,824
Two missing, and the rest
ain't saying shit we can understand.

29
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:52,259
I tried to tell you,
with the questions you all are asking.

30
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:55,297
We step off ship,
English is once again heard, right?

31
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,060
Pretty much, yeah.

32
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,199
Here's what's left of Osman.
He was with us since Trieste.

33
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:06,639
Choksey took all his gear when he jumped.

34
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:10,079
- You get a lot of guys jumping ship?
- Some.

35
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,149
Usually after a pay,
which we made in Norfolk.

36
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,686
Choksey actually asked for an advance,
which we did using ship's scrip.

37
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:22,115
Nothing here in the way of ID papers
or money. He grabbed that at least.

38
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:25,427
Anybody else ask for any advances
while you were at sea?

39
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:28,123
- More than usual.
- Yeah?

40
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:32,498
A few of them were coming back
day after day, scripting more and more cash.

41
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:35,037
We figured they were
gambling down in the holds.

42
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,936
And maybe not, right?

43
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:44,137
The can with the girls was in Bay 9
on the bottom, outside.

44
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:46,409
- Did you check that bay?
- I did.

45
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:49,145
It's full of cans for export,
loaded in Hampton Roads.

46
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:51,687
No sign of anything
except a fresh stack of containers.

47
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:55,656
I'm not gonna lie to you. If you hold us
another day and bring in interpreters...

48
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,556
they're still not gonna say a thing.

49
00:04:57,661 --> 00:05:01,927
The unwritten rule is that what happens
below decks stays below decks.

50
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:12,833
Sit up, Nicky,
we got paying customers waiting.

51
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:17,673
Ashley, sit down.

52
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:22,212
You think I cut it too short?

53
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,383
Just don't make me look funny.

54
00:05:28,258 --> 00:05:30,123
Ashley's preschool called.

55
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:33,196
- They want more money?
- Just what we owe them.

56
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,090
- And her teacher says that--
- Teacher?

57
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:39,434
- They ain't nothing but baby-sitters.
- Whatever.

58
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:42,994
Ashley's been talking in class
about how Mom and Dad don't live together.

59
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:44,596
Who asks her about that?

60
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:47,843
No one asks, she just talks.

61
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:50,778
Kids notice stuff like that.
They talk, you know?

62
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:53,509
By the time she's in elementary school,
it's going to be an issue.

63
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:56,450
Time she gets that far,
we'll be under the same roof.

64
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,515
You said that last Christmas.

65
00:05:58,622 --> 00:06:01,716
Christ, Aimee!
You pulling it out or cutting it?

66
00:06:02,426 --> 00:06:03,916
Listen, Nicky.

67
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:07,828
You want to go get to someplace better,
I'm with you.

68
00:06:08,832 --> 00:06:12,632
You wanna keep on like this,
then I got to rethink stuff.

69
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:17,366
Do what you feel.

70
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:23,143
As soon as I start getting more hours,
the first thing I do is get my own place.

71
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:25,647
You wanna move in with me, great.

72
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:28,946
You don't want to,
at least I did my goddamn best.

73
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,260
You want a streak or something?
I could put a little purple in it.

74
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:46,567
Yeah, and right after that...

75
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,231
I'll just go ahead
and stick my tongue up some guy's ass.

76
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,937
Got you good, huh?

77
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:27,837
You think?

78
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:29,935
No, I mean, not really.

79
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,244
Not if Evidence Control
is the posting you want.

80
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:37,952
- Sorry, Lieutenant.
- Fuck it, right?

81
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:42,117
We brought in the case at least.
Heard you were on the boat.

82
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,993
Ain't so bad.

83
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:49,221
How's Kima?

84
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:51,500
She's inside.

85
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:54,898
Asset Forfeiture.
And she's second year pre-law.

86
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:58,106
Housecat. That ain't her.

87
00:08:00,777 --> 00:08:02,608
- This coming back?
- Yeah.

88
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:05,341
It's the Gant case right there.

89
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:07,178
Nathan looked over our weak shit...

90
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:09,718
told me to go find Omar this week
or she drops charges.

91
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,015
- You got a line on him lately?
- I haven't a clue.

92
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:15,319
Last thing I did
was put him on a bus to New York.

93
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:22,861
You keep your head low, Lieutenant.

94
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:25,434
A year or two,
you'll be back in their favor, right?

95
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:27,901
Year or two, and I'll be a lawyer.

96
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:31,774
I got 22 years in.
I'm putting the papers in this week.

97
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:33,674
You're gone?

98
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:38,442
What the hell am I doing down here
with a law degree, right?

99
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,981
You take care, McNulty.

100
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:43,916
You, too.

101
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:13,075
Kimmy, all I'm trying to say is,
if you'd stop lighting up all the damn time...

102
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:15,913
- maybe you'd understand--
- I'm gonna light up regardless.

103
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,852
- It took us too long.
- You know I love you, but if your ass...

104
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:21,788
don't get to finishing counting
all my motherfucking money...

105
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:25,521
- Shit, you know I love you, but damn.
- Almost five.

106
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:27,893
We got them motherfuckers good.

107
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,001
Let's see them motherfuckers slip next time.

108
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:34,764
Who the fuck is you?

109
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:38,432
- Omar come a-calling.
- Omar? Shit.

110
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:41,978
Ain't that nigger dead?
I heard them project niggers lit him up.

111
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:44,979
No, I heard they ran his ass up
out of this town.

112
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:50,015
Spread the word, darling, Omar back.

113
00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:59,725
Look at the way
Crutchfield spelled "prostrate."

114
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,024
Look at it.

115
00:10:01,598 --> 00:10:04,431
"The above referenced victim
was prostate on the floor."

116
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,937
"Prostate on the floor."
That's a victim, all right.

117
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,530
That hurts bad.

118
00:10:13,443 --> 00:10:15,377
I love this job, I do.

119
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:18,414
- You want to hear about Philly, Sarge?
- Just the dirty parts.

120
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:21,746
The ship's a dead end.
The cargo bay that held our container...

121
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:24,184
is full of new boxes,
nothing to recover there.

122
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:27,983
And all them sailors, they lied to us
in every language past English.

123
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:29,319
Gibbering motherfuckers.

124
00:10:29,426 --> 00:10:31,587
Sailing up the coast right now,
laughing at us.

125
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:33,688
Is that it?

126
00:10:33,797 --> 00:10:36,459
Two guys jumped ship.
We'll put out teletypes...

127
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:38,659
in case that has
anything to do with anything.

128
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,793
One of them left his gear, and we kept that.

129
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:44,373
- Sounds like some weak-ass shit to me.
- Because it is.

130
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,677
But your suspect
had to be on the boat, right?

131
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:49,244
And your boat has sailed.

132
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:52,577
Jay, what the fuck were we supposed to do?

133
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:56,209
Hold the ship while we chat up
a crew of 40 in 53 dialects? Come on.

134
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:59,385
If that isn't the plan, what is?

135
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:12,160
- Officer...
- Russell.

136
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:16,503
I am informed that you are detailed
to this case...

137
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:19,040
as a liaison with the port police.

138
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:24,945
I also understand
that you are the only help...

139
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:26,515
that your department is sending.

140
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:27,708
That so?

141
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:31,719
Although there is some small charm
to a woman in uniform...

142
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:34,984
the fact remains
we work plainclothes in Homicide.

143
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:37,960
Which is not to say
that the clothes need be plain.

144
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:41,929
For you, I would suggest some pantsuits,
perhaps muted in color.

145
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:46,059
Something to offset Det. Moreland's
pinstriped lawyerly affectations...

146
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:49,696
and the brash, tweedy impertinence
of Det. Freamon.

147
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:52,804
Rawls is watching on this one.

148
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:56,936
Let's at least pretend we got a fucking clue.

149
00:11:59,382 --> 00:12:01,145
Tweedy impertinence?

150
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:06,749
- I like that.
- You know what I'm saying?

151
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:11,654
- It's not here, Major.
- I can see that. Where is it?

152
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:14,056
The Flex Squad used it last Tuesday.

153
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:17,258
The vehicle log says
they parked it at 22:00 hours...

154
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,198
returning the keys to the OIC.

155
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:21,497
- And?
- We have the keys.

156
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:23,931
But not the van?

157
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:28,709
Are you telling me that a fully equipped...

158
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:32,339
$120,000 surveillance van...

159
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:35,976
assigned to the southeastern district
cannot be located?

160
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:56,635
- Around the world...
- In 880 days.

161
00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:17,383
- Do we have a plan?
- A plan?

162
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:21,252
- For targeting this guy, Sobotka.
- I don't know.

163
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:25,464
Maybe find out where his union hangs...

164
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:28,628
go down there with a CI or two,
make some hand-to-hands.

165
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:31,730
- How about some DNRs on his phones?
- DNRs?

166
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:34,742
See who he's calling,
and look for any kind of pattern.

167
00:13:34,844 --> 00:13:37,142
Hand-to-hands for now, I think.

168
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,071
600 series, and that's it.

169
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,016
That's right.

170
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:18,044
This is too nice a block for a prison guard.

171
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:21,214
Shit, you couldn't pay me enough
to work in no prison, man.

172
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:24,157
Yeah, right, no.
I want you to drop all the cellular joints.

173
00:14:24,294 --> 00:14:29,163
- Yeah, all of them, Nokia, Motorola.
- Listen to Stringer play Wall Street.

174
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,730
All right, so call me, yeah.

175
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:35,498
String, why you so down
on the phone companies, man?

176
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:38,800
While back, I took a stroll through the Pit.

177
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:42,036
I saw that kid
we got running things down there, Poot.

178
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,640
He got the cellphone I gave him
for the business, right there on his hip...

179
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,880
but the nigger got another cellphone
that only ring when the pussy called.

180
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:53,421
Now, if this no-count nigger
got two cellphones...

181
00:14:53,523 --> 00:14:57,152
how the fuck you gonna sell
any more of them motherfuckers?

182
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:59,518
That's market saturation.

183
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:05,726
Look here.

184
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,138
That Tilghman right there.

185
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:12,675
- Dressed like a prison guard and all.
- Yeah, I see him.

186
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:19,978
Steel door.
The boy on the step is all, though.

187
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,780
Stump is sitting in the front room window,
staring at the damn television.

188
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:27,948
- You all could see that from the step?
- There in his damn drawers.

189
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:34,596
Shut up, dog!

190
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:41,235
Rat make that trash, he home free.

191
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:45,002
Junk better get in closer
if he want a shot at him.

192
00:15:48,878 --> 00:15:52,177
I got $20 on Mr. Rat. Anyone fade me?

193
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:56,312
Move along. Come on, get there.

194
00:15:57,921 --> 00:15:59,889
$100 says it ain't over.

195
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:02,287
Shit, I got to take easy money.

196
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:05,417
What the fuck?

197
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,227
- Motherfucker.
- Sounds about over now, though.

198
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:15,033
How the hell you know
what the rat gonna do?

199
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:17,129
Junk do know his varmints.

200
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,582
Yeah.

201
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:41,119
What's wrong with you, boy?

202
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,262
Look, I done told you before, man.
Those two babies don't move me that way.

203
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:51,169
If I come up with a plan
to do Stump without them...

204
00:16:51,274 --> 00:16:52,901
you cut them loose?

205
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:55,603
Now you gone and got strategic on me?

206
00:16:56,112 --> 00:16:59,275
We do like last time,
and wait for him to come out.

207
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:03,285
Only problem is,
Stump live in that rat hole, baby.

208
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:09,486
So, he ain't got to bring the cash out.
See what I'm saying?

209
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:13,052
Then we charge in, guns a-blazing.

210
00:17:13,963 --> 00:17:15,624
Steel door, right?

211
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:20,859
What's it gonna take
for you to be convinced, man?

212
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,870
I don't bag no babies.

213
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:29,268
What you think?

214
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:54,228
You gonna have to do better than that.

215
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:56,799
Indeed.

216
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,277
Thinking, maybe do a quarter this time,
if it's not too much.

217
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:10,619
That a problem?

218
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:12,379
No.

219
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:16,890
I'm just saying, you back right quick with it.

220
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:22,492
It ain't like them motherfuckers
got anything else to do up in there, right?

221
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:26,557
- The shit is everyday, man.
- Sounds right. It count right, too?

222
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:31,035
Boy'll bring it to you outside.

223
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,707
There's Tilghman.

224
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:51,085
So, his shit coming from Butchie then?

225
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:55,664
- All right.
- Lying Butchie.

226
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:02,703
- Santa's elves are short.
- Santa's elves aren't real.

227
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:05,296
The elves in Lord of the Rings
are, like, real elves.

228
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:08,036
- Real elves?
- They should be short, then.

229
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:12,911
Dwarves are short, hobbits are short.
Elves are tall and immortal.

230
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:16,918
If you weren't too scared to watch the movie
then you'd know all about it, doofus.

231
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,248
Bite me, dickbreath.

232
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:21,255
- Sean, knock it off.
- He started it.

233
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:25,286
Okay, upstairs right away,
brush your teeth, pajamas.

234
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:27,386
It's a school night, Sean.

235
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:30,226
Can I tuck them in?

236
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:37,027
My lawyer's gonna be
sending you something in the mail.

237
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,802
- You're kidding.
- It's not a divorce, it's an agreement.

238
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:42,844
- A separation agreement.
- A separation agreement?

239
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:46,437
Just read it. Okay? It's for the both of us.

240
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:48,073
It's to protect the both of us.

241
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:49,674
This is about what?

242
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,684
It's just...

243
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:55,219
You should just read it, okay?

244
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:00,428
Okay.

245
00:20:17,547 --> 00:20:20,311
Another goddamn day we put our cards up
and get nothing.

246
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:25,177
- Zig, I don't know why I fucking bother.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

247
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:28,112
One ship today, nothing yesterday.

248
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:30,556
Wait for Thursday,
a couple ROIROs hit the berth...

249
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,288
and congratu-fucking-lations,
you grab a day.

250
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:35,159
Friday's quiet again.

251
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:38,563
Look at it this way, you know,
at least you get the day off.

252
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:41,159
Days off is the fucking point, Zig.

253
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,309
I can't keep waking up in the morning
not knowing if I'm gonna get paid.

254
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,843
I got a kid, right? I got a fucking kid...

255
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:53,916
and a girl that wants
to get married, for Christ's sake.

256
00:20:54,016 --> 00:20:56,712
What the fuck you wanna get married for?

257
00:20:58,054 --> 00:20:59,646
Not saying I do.

258
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:03,220
But fuck if I even could,
without no pot to piss in.

259
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,888
Aimee is like, "What's the plan," you know?

260
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:11,592
And I'm down here
wondering if I'm gonna get a day or two.

261
00:21:13,803 --> 00:21:16,636
Aimee's sister broke up with Petie, right?

262
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:21,568
That's your problem, Zig,
one of them, anyway.

263
00:21:21,677 --> 00:21:23,907
You let that thing of yours lead you around.

264
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:25,913
You know me, whiskey, cock, and 5:00.

265
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:28,006
- Just get off me.
- Nicky, look.

266
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:31,744
If it's money that you're worried about, shit.

267
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:34,886
Let's pool a few dollars together.

268
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:38,085
I'll get us hooked up
with a little Yeyo, you know...

269
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:41,095
turn it around this morning,
we make more money before lunch...

270
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:42,960
than we can down here all week.

271
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:46,400
I ain't standing out on no corner
like some fucking project nigger...

272
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:49,027
so that I get popped for pocket change.

273
00:21:49,138 --> 00:21:52,733
Fuck that shit, Zig. Seriously.

274
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:56,836
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll think of something.

275
00:22:02,585 --> 00:22:04,883
11900 on that one.

276
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:08,547
We're looking for 14580, by the manifest.

277
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,949
Can't be, the numbers don't go that high.

278
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,790
You had to figure it'd be this way,
the way the port works.

279
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:14,885
Yeah?

280
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:17,022
Why have anything
other than fake companies...

281
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:20,398
and addresses on the manifest
if you're moving a can with contraband?

282
00:22:20,503 --> 00:22:22,869
And on the other end, too, right?

283
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,571
You can work it back through customs,
but chances are...

284
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:31,636
this box wasn't picked up anywhere
near this Rue de Rivoli address...

285
00:22:31,747 --> 00:22:33,908
in Le Havre, France.

286
00:22:34,016 --> 00:22:37,679
Hell, there might not even
be a Rue de Rivoli in that town.

287
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:44,885
A can full of dead girls,
sent to nowhere from nowhere.

288
00:23:11,587 --> 00:23:14,522
- He been good business for me, though.
- Yeah?

289
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:16,524
Two, three quarters a week.

290
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:19,117
Mr. Tilghman's money always right,
always on time.

291
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:21,924
That's why we coming to you for the setup.

292
00:23:22,031 --> 00:23:24,090
- You the man to him.
- I'm just saying.

293
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,533
I know, the money, and you know
we gonna find a way to make that right.

294
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:30,538
But like I said, I'm not asking for myself.

295
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,433
Now I'm asking for my man.

296
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:38,305
- Avon's call?
- Wouldn't be here otherwise.

297
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:44,211
- Avon is Avon.
- Always.

298
00:23:49,492 --> 00:23:52,154
He probably gonna roll past tomorrow.

299
00:23:54,196 --> 00:23:55,663
That'll work.

300
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:04,770
You see what I'm saying, right?

301
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:07,672
It makes no sense to bring the girls
all this way and then kill them.

302
00:24:07,777 --> 00:24:11,611
You go all that way to dump it on your boss,
and now you're worrying yourself.

303
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:14,911
- It's got me thinking is all.
- It's a little late for that, McNulty.

304
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:18,544
What connects the one girl in the water
with all the other ones in the can?

305
00:24:18,754 --> 00:24:22,451
- If you're right and she isn't local, then--
- She's definitely not local.

306
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:24,219
The low level of mercury viscosity...

307
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:27,160
in the amalgam restorations
says Eastern Europe.

308
00:24:27,263 --> 00:24:30,130
- If you say so.
- Trust me, she's not from Dundalk.

309
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:33,463
Eastern Europe?
Can you narrow it down some?

310
00:24:34,303 --> 00:24:38,637
How's this? Three of the dead girls were
in Budapest, Hungary sometime last year.

311
00:24:38,741 --> 00:24:40,732
How'd you know that?

312
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:42,908
They bought tits there.

313
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,443
Three of the girls had breast enhancements.
We looked at the bags during the post.

314
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,177
We pulled the lot and serial numbers...

315
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:53,449
and they trace back to an outpatient
plastic surgery clinic in Budapest.

316
00:24:53,556 --> 00:24:56,582
Would you call them?
Might pull an ID from patient records.

317
00:24:56,692 --> 00:25:00,184
The best they could tell me is the implants
were used some time this fall.

318
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:03,129
Three girls, three surgeries,
same clinic, right?

319
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,325
- What else?
- What else?

320
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:08,198
- Fuck you, Jimmy McNulty.
- Okay, you're a fucking god.

321
00:25:08,304 --> 00:25:11,865
There's no one in the game
who can stand in your light, Dr. Frazier, sir.

322
00:25:11,974 --> 00:25:15,432
You have to admit that whole
Budapest thing was a hell of a pull.

323
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:19,036
- Where's the paperwork on this cat?
- I got it over here.

324
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:20,677
So go on, what else?

325
00:25:20,783 --> 00:25:24,480
Not much, except the swabs show
that at least seven of the girls in the box...

326
00:25:24,587 --> 00:25:27,488
had vaginal intercourse
within 24 hours of death.

327
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,388
Two had anal and six came back positive
on the oral.

328
00:25:32,027 --> 00:25:34,086
You tell Cole about all this?

329
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:37,632
I sent the findings off to Homicide,
but Cole ain't on the case, brother.

330
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:39,598
- No, who is?
- It's your man, Bunk.

331
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:42,694
And that older guy, his partner, they ate it.

332
00:25:46,108 --> 00:25:47,302
Thanks.

333
00:25:56,652 --> 00:26:00,349
I told you, I brought you a soda.

334
00:26:00,456 --> 00:26:01,855
That better?

335
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:06,191
Now, look at me.
Don't let those mean boys see you crying.

336
00:26:06,862 --> 00:26:08,420
- Okay?
- Okay.

337
00:26:09,131 --> 00:26:10,962
I'll take care of you.

338
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,317
Mr. Stump!

339
00:26:40,763 --> 00:26:43,459
Them boys been teasing Chantelle again.

340
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:54,975
You know it.

341
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:09,144
- Morning.
- Morning.

342
00:28:13,255 --> 00:28:15,985
- Bobby, how you been?
- Not bad.

343
00:28:16,358 --> 00:28:20,158
- Working the tier today?
- Yeah, on J.

344
00:28:25,134 --> 00:28:27,466
- Have a good one.
- Yeah, you, too.

345
00:28:28,237 --> 00:28:30,569
You happy now, bitch?

346
00:28:30,673 --> 00:28:33,039
How was I gonna know
Landsman would pull Cole...

347
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:34,575
and stick you guys?

348
00:28:34,677 --> 00:28:36,406
You right here with them?

349
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:38,912
- What did he call Cole?
- "Collateral damage."

350
00:28:39,014 --> 00:28:41,915
I'm feeling pretty damn collateral myself,
I got to say.

351
00:28:42,017 --> 00:28:45,680
Which is why I went to see Dr. Frazier
and work some things out in my head.

352
00:28:45,788 --> 00:28:49,053
Officer McNulty could've
paid this thing no mind, but no.

353
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:51,649
When his friends are suffering,
he bleeds, too.

354
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,853
Did you see the preliminary?

355
00:28:54,463 --> 00:28:56,931
Positives for oral, vaginal, anal.

356
00:28:57,032 --> 00:29:00,058
No IDs, no passports, no visas,
no real money.

357
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:02,194
And they're coming
across the water like that.

358
00:29:02,304 --> 00:29:04,431
- Yeah.
- McNulty has a theory.

359
00:29:05,107 --> 00:29:08,543
- Does he now?
- You deductive motherfucker, you.

360
00:29:08,644 --> 00:29:12,011
So he's gonna wander in here
with some Johnny-come-lately bullshit...

361
00:29:12,114 --> 00:29:15,208
about how these girls
are all coming over here as prostitutes...

362
00:29:15,317 --> 00:29:19,481
talking about how if they ain't got the cash
to travel better than a container ship...

363
00:29:19,588 --> 00:29:22,216
then they sure don't have the money
for a plastic surgeon.

364
00:29:22,324 --> 00:29:25,293
Then he's gonna say something
about that one in the water...

365
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:28,921
being tossed off the ship
after she's already dead from a beat-down.

366
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:32,797
But why she got beat?
He's gonna ask us that, like we don't know.

367
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:36,928
He's gonna answer his own question,
saying her swabs are negative, right?

368
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,372
Fuck or fight with all them sailor boys,
and she fought.

369
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:42,273
So, it got a little rough.

370
00:29:42,378 --> 00:29:45,541
She gets banged around,
she comes up dead.

371
00:29:45,648 --> 00:29:48,583
And then somebody panics,
tosses her in the harbor overnight...

372
00:29:48,684 --> 00:29:49,810
before the ship ties up.

373
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:51,215
But the other girls saw.

374
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,687
So now, the other girls,
they get told to get back in that can.

375
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,258
And our man, to cover this shit up...

376
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,260
he gets up on top
and bangs down the air pipe.

377
00:30:03,766 --> 00:30:07,258
- Anything else you want to tell us?
- When did you guys get there?

378
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:11,237
Yesterday, when the ship's first mate
told us that while the ship was at sea...

379
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,104
half the crew came to him
for advances on their salary.

380
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:16,837
They had one hell of a dice game
going on below deck...

381
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:18,879
or the boys popped them girls
out of that can.

382
00:30:18,981 --> 00:30:20,278
You talk to the crew?

383
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:22,475
- In what language?
- Crime scene?

384
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:24,518
- Nope.
- Anybody missing?

385
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,453
Two guys jumped ship.
One in Philly, one in Norfolk.

386
00:30:27,556 --> 00:30:30,423
But that shit happens all the time,
apparently.

387
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,287
- Got yourself a hell of a case.
- Fuck you very much.

388
00:30:35,898 --> 00:30:38,833
You know what happens to all the girls
if you don't ID them?

389
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:42,062
Anatomy Board as medical cadavers.
Then a crematorium.

390
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:44,264
Then that mass grave out at Crownsville.

391
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:45,840
That bothers you?

392
00:30:46,141 --> 00:30:47,506
Yeah, a little.

393
00:30:47,676 --> 00:30:48,938
Me, too.

394
00:30:57,052 --> 00:30:59,782
- Thanks for hosting this, Father.
- Hope it helps.

395
00:30:59,888 --> 00:31:02,322
You guys have really done
the background on this.

396
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:05,484
This is more presence
than the port unions have shown in years.

397
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:09,030
- Is the governor listening?
- It's now or never for us.

398
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:11,866
And not just the grain pier,
but with the dredging.

399
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:14,458
I don't care
what the Corps of Engineers' study says.

400
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,197
- The fact remains--
- Excuse me, Bobby.

401
00:31:16,305 --> 00:31:19,968
I just need him to work
the other side of the room on something.

402
00:31:21,744 --> 00:31:23,268
You're wasting time here.

403
00:31:24,546 --> 00:31:27,071
Bobby's District 7, which is middle river...

404
00:31:27,182 --> 00:31:30,447
which means every vote he gets
is somebody with some port connection.

405
00:31:30,552 --> 00:31:32,520
He's a good vote, no matter what we do.

406
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:34,816
The guys you need to be working
are the guys...

407
00:31:34,923 --> 00:31:37,551
who wouldn't have come
if we hadn't been throwing money at them.

408
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:40,560
- Like who?
- Like John Carney, from Anne Arundel.

409
00:31:40,662 --> 00:31:43,859
Liz Tobin, from Montgomery.
Clay Davis, from over Westside.

410
00:31:43,966 --> 00:31:46,764
Keep hold of them,
some of your stuff stays in the budgets.

411
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:49,497
- And they're with us?
- Carney is pretty firm.

412
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:52,597
Liz will stay solid if the environmentalists
don't get to her.

413
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:56,872
Clay Davis... that guy, you wanna make sure
you're the last man out of the room.

414
00:31:56,979 --> 00:31:58,344
What do you mean?

415
00:31:58,447 --> 00:32:01,814
I mean, we've given forty large
to the Westside Democratic Organization...

416
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:04,084
and this motherfucker still has his hand out.

417
00:32:04,186 --> 00:32:05,813
We spent $40,000 on that guy?

418
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:09,516
Worth it, if he lets your projects
sail through the conference committee.

419
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:13,493
- Forty fuckin' thousand?
- Am I your lobbyist? Are you paying me?

420
00:32:13,695 --> 00:32:15,993
Trust me. With the players in this room...

421
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:19,192
the presiding officers and a little help
from the governor's office...

422
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:21,769
we might squeeze some things out
this session.

423
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,565
Now, go make nice.

424
00:32:27,843 --> 00:32:30,505
- Senator Davis.
- Excuse me.

425
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:33,737
Hey, partner.

426
00:32:35,217 --> 00:32:38,015
People tell me
it just might be a good year for the port.

427
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,417
Might be.

428
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:42,215
You all have been stepping up
in a lot of ways.

429
00:32:42,324 --> 00:32:46,954
Hope it continues like that.
You all making friends in a lot of places?

430
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,892
We're friendly guys.

431
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:02,402
So they came back murders?

432
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:04,775
I admit, I didn't see that coming at all.

433
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:07,047
Who could've seen that?

434
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:10,074
For whoever was having
these girls brought over...

435
00:33:10,185 --> 00:33:12,619
- the net loss is in the millions.
- That much?

436
00:33:12,721 --> 00:33:16,384
One of these girls on the circuit,
going club-to-club on the East Coast...

437
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:18,959
can bring in half a million
over the next two years.

438
00:33:19,061 --> 00:33:21,427
And that's just
for club work and prostitution.

439
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,124
- So somebody messed up.
- In a big way.

440
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:27,527
You guys called it.
No such address in Le Havre.

441
00:33:27,736 --> 00:33:30,330
Or for that matter, anywhere in Brittany.

442
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:33,533
The name and ID of the driver
who signed the bill of lading...

443
00:33:33,642 --> 00:33:36,167
doesn't correspond
to their motor vehicle database.

444
00:33:36,278 --> 00:33:38,075
Dead ends either way.

445
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,144
The girls, they know
what they're coming over for?

446
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,342
Some do.

447
00:33:42,451 --> 00:33:45,011
Some get told they're gonna dance,
or be secretaries.

448
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,521
You gotta understand, they're coming
from places that don't have much.

449
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:50,956
Romania, Moldavia, Russia, Albania.

450
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:54,358
40,000 or 50,000 undocumented women
working in the US alone.

451
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:56,454
50,000? Jesus.

452
00:33:56,765 --> 00:33:59,700
They need a whole new agency
just to police them.

453
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:01,860
What they need is a union.

454
00:34:03,972 --> 00:34:07,237
- To Stan and Kate.
- Stan and Kate.

455
00:34:09,678 --> 00:34:11,339
Happy anniversary!

456
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:14,448
Thanks a lot.

457
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:19,651
- Good time here?
- Yeah.

458
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:21,723
How is my detail coming?

459
00:34:22,658 --> 00:34:24,922
Lt. Grayson is on top of things, right?

460
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:29,293
Burrell recommended him.
Said he was really good at property crimes.

461
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:33,694
- It's gonna take a while.
- You think?

462
00:34:33,802 --> 00:34:35,793
Why? What are you doing?

463
00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:39,068
Not much.

464
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:43,776
We got no DNRs up.
We're not looking at any union assets.

465
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:46,279
We're not collecting tag numbers
or anything.

466
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:49,214
We're not looking for patterns at all.
And that's the thing.

467
00:34:49,318 --> 00:34:51,582
I'm trying to tell you
about the Barksdale thing.

468
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:54,679
If you go in with the idea
you're gonna eat around the edges...

469
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,087
you never get a meal.

470
00:34:56,191 --> 00:34:59,490
With Barksdale, Daniels and Freamon
had us pulling all kinds of stuff.

471
00:34:59,594 --> 00:35:02,154
DMV records, phone logs,
corporate charter stuff...

472
00:35:02,264 --> 00:35:03,993
political campaign contributions.

473
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:06,226
If Burrell didn't
break the case down so fast...

474
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:10,032
we would've brought back $3 or $4 million
in downtown real estate...

475
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:13,198
not to mention the money
those guys gave to political campaigns.

476
00:35:13,308 --> 00:35:17,836
We were deep, really deep.
I've been trying to tell you.

477
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:23,044
If it wasn't for Burrell,
that would've been a major case.

478
00:35:33,695 --> 00:35:37,529
- String.
- You know, I just came to check up on you.

479
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:41,325
- See how you holding it down.
- I'm all right.

480
00:35:41,703 --> 00:35:44,797
- Where the little man at?
- I just put him down.

481
00:35:49,378 --> 00:35:51,505
You want something to drink?

482
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,510
Do D'Angelo know what he's missing?

483
00:35:57,953 --> 00:35:59,477
I'm sure he do.

484
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:06,085
You just reminded me about something.

485
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,332
Tag's still on it.

486
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,573
He bought it
before he got stopped in Jersey.

487
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,538
Never been worn.

488
00:36:27,883 --> 00:36:31,011
You know,
it's a shame to let things go to waste.

489
00:36:34,823 --> 00:36:37,621
You know,
you can give away the man's clothes...

490
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:40,217
but that don't make him gone, right?

491
00:36:40,328 --> 00:36:41,556
I ain't forget him.

492
00:36:41,663 --> 00:36:43,688
You ain't been to see him
much neither, though.

493
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:45,960
- It's been hard.
- It's been hard?

494
00:36:46,068 --> 00:36:47,558
It's been hard on him, too.

495
00:36:47,669 --> 00:36:49,762
A lot of bad things
caught up in a man's head...

496
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:52,806
when he's on lock-down.
Man need to see his baby mama.

497
00:36:52,908 --> 00:36:54,375
Need to see his child, too.

498
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:57,468
Only one thing he needs to be secure about,
and if not...

499
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,647
then he might start thinking
he can't do that time...

500
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,945
and then we all got problems.

501
00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:06,080
You understand me?

502
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:08,886
How you set here?

503
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:12,084
The apartment, the car,
the money's all right?

504
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:15,221
- It's good.
- It's good?

505
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:18,724
I know it's good.

506
00:37:20,335 --> 00:37:22,633
But you know what I'm talking about, right?

507
00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:26,867
We all got a job to do, and your job
is to let D'Angelo know we still family.

508
00:37:29,344 --> 00:37:30,868
It's important.

509
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:41,019
I'm an XL.

510
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:47,223
No doubt.

511
00:38:45,587 --> 00:38:48,283
- Your round, Jimmy.
- Jesus.

512
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,585
I'm gonna owe the baby-sitter
half my salary...

513
00:38:50,692 --> 00:38:52,785
if I don't throw myself out of here right now.

514
00:38:52,894 --> 00:38:54,828
- You got kids?
- Two.

515
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:58,491
- Daddy working late, too?
- Not a day in his goddamn life.

516
00:39:00,735 --> 00:39:02,600
You barely made a dent.

517
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,802
Good night, gents.

518
00:39:06,908 --> 00:39:08,773
- Good night.
- Good night.

519
00:39:09,511 --> 00:39:12,002
- What's that about?
- I don't know.

520
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:17,212
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

521
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:19,810
- Solve the fucking case?
- Not a shot.

522
00:39:23,091 --> 00:39:25,821
- I'm gonna give this one a name.
- A name?

523
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:30,159
She's not going
out to Crownsville, this one.

524
00:39:30,265 --> 00:39:33,359
- Not on me, she's not.
- So what are you gonna do with her?

525
00:39:33,468 --> 00:39:37,302
Pay for a box and a mortician
and ship her back to Bumfuck, Europe?

526
00:39:37,405 --> 00:39:39,703
No, I'm gonna find where her people at.

527
00:39:39,808 --> 00:39:44,006
How does that matter?
You see, this is that Catholic shit, Jimmy.

528
00:39:44,713 --> 00:39:47,648
This is that little altar-boy-guilt talking.

529
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:50,876
What the fuck I got to feel guilty about?

530
00:39:50,986 --> 00:39:52,817
Let me count the ways.

531
00:39:56,391 --> 00:39:58,154
Good morning, Major.

532
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,477
What the...

533
00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:30,486
Wilmington? Son of a bitch!

534
00:40:36,898 --> 00:40:40,095
- Frank?
- Ring, how's it hanging?

535
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:43,571
Not so good.

536
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:46,696
- Not right now.
- Yeah?

537
00:40:48,977 --> 00:40:51,775
I'm late on my dues. You know that, right?

538
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,245
You're late, yeah.

539
00:40:54,049 --> 00:40:57,280
And I'm parking that piece-of-shit Buick
two blocks from the house...

540
00:40:57,385 --> 00:40:59,444
hoping for a lazy repo man.

541
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:01,183
That bad?

542
00:41:01,923 --> 00:41:05,222
I know you ain't been getting hours,
it's been slow.

543
00:41:06,094 --> 00:41:07,618
Five days last month.

544
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:09,629
- That's all.
- Is that all?

545
00:41:10,432 --> 00:41:13,333
Look, I got to shit or get off the pot here.

546
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:16,897
- I'm gonna go with 47.
- Do me a favor.

547
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:19,637
Frank, you been fair,
I ain't saying otherwise.

548
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:24,144
It's just there's 60 checkers above me
with more seniority, and that's all she wrote.

549
00:41:24,245 --> 00:41:26,679
Do me a favor.
Go down Clement Street tonight...

550
00:41:26,781 --> 00:41:30,683
give this to Dolores,
tell her you need a beer and a shot on me.

551
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:34,382
Just do that much.
You have a round on me, you go home.

552
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:38,482
You wanna come in tomorrow, tell me
you're going with 47, I'm with you on it.

553
00:41:40,362 --> 00:41:41,556
Thanks.

554
00:41:58,279 --> 00:42:01,214
Lane 4, you got a trucker's code and tag.

555
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:13,094
Pick me a winner, Johnny.

556
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,702
- You're ugly enough to be a teamster.
- Lick me, you whore.

557
00:42:34,315 --> 00:42:37,978
It'll be up on wheels. K-row, slot 122.

558
00:42:39,354 --> 00:42:40,685
Roger that.

559
00:42:56,037 --> 00:42:57,868
Look, misdelivery.

560
00:42:58,106 --> 00:43:00,506
Can was supposed to go ashore at Norfolk.

561
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:05,141
- Yeah, where you want it?
- I'm gonna need it on wheels at K-122.

562
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:07,874
My man'll pick it up there. Thanks, Horse.

563
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:08,969
Wrong box, misdelivery.

564
00:44:18,553 --> 00:44:20,180
No need to count, Butch.

565
00:44:20,288 --> 00:44:22,483
- My shit always right.
- Hearing.

566
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,089
Hearing is believing.

567
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,629
Boy'll meet you outside
when you ready to roll.

568
00:44:32,734 --> 00:44:34,258
I'm ready now.

569
00:44:38,139 --> 00:44:41,131
No, dog. Not from me you don't.

570
00:44:43,811 --> 00:44:45,335
Later, Butchie.

571
00:44:50,351 --> 00:44:53,013
Your man Avon ain't got no flex.

572
00:44:53,488 --> 00:44:54,853
Afraid not.

573
00:45:05,934 --> 00:45:08,869
Who you like better?
Ultimate Spiderman or regular Spiderman?

574
00:45:09,571 --> 00:45:13,371
- What's the difference?
- See, I'll have to teach you everything.

575
00:45:23,585 --> 00:45:25,177
Excuse me, gents.

576
00:45:29,057 --> 00:45:31,992
What's up, man? How you liking the library?

577
00:45:33,094 --> 00:45:34,356
It'll do.

578
00:45:36,998 --> 00:45:38,590
It's easy on you.

579
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,659
I know a lot of people put in for the gig,
but the gig go to you.

580
00:45:43,037 --> 00:45:44,698
Funny how that go.

581
00:45:45,573 --> 00:45:47,871
So you want me to say thanks?

582
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:49,840
You ain't got to say shit.

583
00:45:49,944 --> 00:45:52,469
But you need to take heed
of what can be done for you...

584
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,207
if you keep your head straight.

585
00:45:54,315 --> 00:45:56,783
You're just full of favors, ain't you?

586
00:45:57,952 --> 00:46:01,581
You shut your mouth and open your mind...

587
00:46:02,056 --> 00:46:05,389
and you ain't gonna be doing
but a small piece of this 20.

588
00:46:05,493 --> 00:46:08,553
Just like I'm only gonna do
a year or two on this seven.

589
00:46:08,663 --> 00:46:11,291
- Feel me?
- I got priors.

590
00:46:11,399 --> 00:46:16,063
Best I can do is half.
That's 10. I can count to 10.

591
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:20,671
Some shit is coming down, Dee, okay?
You need to think.

592
00:46:21,442 --> 00:46:24,878
You need to trust,
and you need to get your head right.

593
00:46:25,113 --> 00:46:27,240
Man, my head is where I want it.

594
00:46:27,348 --> 00:46:29,782
- You look dusty lately.
- So what?

595
00:46:30,785 --> 00:46:32,810
What, you my mom up in here now?

596
00:46:34,689 --> 00:46:37,249
That's the weak man's road you're taking.

597
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:40,390
I ain't never seen you as weak.

598
00:46:43,197 --> 00:46:46,291
Look, I'm just, you know,
every now and again.

599
00:46:47,335 --> 00:46:49,997
That's all I got
to get my head up out of this shithole.

600
00:46:50,104 --> 00:46:52,629
Ain't no more than that?
Because if that's all it is...

601
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,072
you should be able
to give it a rest for a few days.

602
00:46:55,176 --> 00:46:58,873
- Because it ain't no thing, right?
- Yeah, it ain't no thing.

603
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,980
Then you gonna do that?

604
00:47:04,552 --> 00:47:07,783
I'm asking you, man, out of love.

605
00:47:09,724 --> 00:47:11,692
There's always love, Dee.

606
00:47:17,231 --> 00:47:19,597
All right. Yeah.

607
00:47:20,568 --> 00:47:23,196
A few days. Sure, a few days.

608
00:47:24,806 --> 00:47:25,966
Right.

609
00:48:13,855 --> 00:48:16,653
All right, what have you got?

610
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:20,116
All digital. Four megapix,
16 megs of memory...

611
00:48:20,228 --> 00:48:23,823
3X optical, 4X digital zoom.
That's brand new on the market.

612
00:48:23,931 --> 00:48:25,865
That's the Cadillac of cameras right there.

613
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:27,457
- How many?
- 400.

614
00:48:28,336 --> 00:48:32,568
- You are talking a big number.
- That's showtime. This ain't the WNBA.

615
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:35,775
I'm thinking with these features,
this brand...

616
00:48:35,877 --> 00:48:38,971
I can get, maybe, $350 each at retail.

617
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,640
- All right, cool.
- Nope, not cool.

618
00:48:41,749 --> 00:48:42,773
$500.

619
00:48:43,718 --> 00:48:46,516
Yeah, I've been calling
some of the local chain stores.

620
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:48,555
You know, Best Buy, Circuit City.

621
00:48:48,656 --> 00:48:52,251
This model goes for $550,
$500 when they're on sale.

622
00:48:53,027 --> 00:48:55,860
Okay, $500.

623
00:48:56,497 --> 00:48:59,762
- Times 400 units, that comes to--
- That's $200,000.

624
00:49:00,902 --> 00:49:02,494
What are you looking for?

625
00:49:02,603 --> 00:49:06,232
Twenty percent. There's three of us.

626
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:09,005
I want a woman with thin ankles.

627
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:12,409
But I'm going to go home tonight,
and there's going to be my wife.

628
00:49:12,513 --> 00:49:15,744
Eight percent. $16,000.

629
00:49:16,017 --> 00:49:19,282
That's over $5,000 apiece
for you and your friends.

630
00:49:21,155 --> 00:49:23,749
$20,000. Upfront.

631
00:49:27,528 --> 00:49:29,257
Because I like you.

632
00:49:29,897 --> 00:49:32,866
Look at that.
It's a Kodak moment in the house.

633
00:49:37,772 --> 00:49:40,206
I got to run this by my people.

634
00:49:40,308 --> 00:49:42,868
They okay it, I'm going to give you a call.

635
00:49:43,911 --> 00:49:45,378
All right, cool.

636
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,554
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

637
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:59,685
You gonna insult my ace,
you check-and-raise piece of shit?

638
00:49:59,794 --> 00:50:03,730
- Fuck you, Augie, see it or fold.
- I'll see it and raise you back.

639
00:50:04,532 --> 00:50:06,727
- Talk to me, Augie.
- Ten-hut.

640
00:50:11,472 --> 00:50:13,099
Where's the lieutenant?

641
00:50:13,274 --> 00:50:16,402
He's on the street.

642
00:50:33,494 --> 00:50:36,986
I'm not a politician.
I wouldn't even know how to count votes.

643
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:39,728
Maybe they know it's our time.

644
00:50:42,103 --> 00:50:43,195
Tony.

645
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:47,973
Too soon to call you Commissioner?

646
00:50:49,143 --> 00:50:50,804
Excuse me one sec.

647
00:50:53,281 --> 00:50:55,749
- You sent me humps.
- Major?

648
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:58,410
You sent me a detail of humps, Ervin.

649
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:02,353
- We can discuss this tomorrow.
- No, I think we discuss it now...

650
00:51:02,623 --> 00:51:05,717
or I'm gonna walk in there and tell Santoni...

651
00:51:05,826 --> 00:51:08,420
to vote against this goddamn coronation.

652
00:51:08,529 --> 00:51:11,987
And more than that, I'm gonna talk
some shit to some of my friends...

653
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:14,727
about what happened
at the end of the Barksdale case.

654
00:51:14,835 --> 00:51:15,824
You hear me on that?

655
00:51:15,937 --> 00:51:19,168
The Barksdale case
was a successful prosecution.

656
00:51:19,273 --> 00:51:22,071
Up until our people
tried to chase the cash, maybe.

657
00:51:22,176 --> 00:51:26,203
We have a quorum, I believe.
Council members can take their seats now.

658
00:51:29,483 --> 00:51:33,146
Tell you what, Deputy.
You probably still got enough votes...

659
00:51:33,254 --> 00:51:35,654
but I can make it uglier than you want it.

660
00:51:35,756 --> 00:51:37,053
What do you want, Stan?

661
00:51:37,158 --> 00:51:41,618
I want a real detail,
with real police and a real unit commander.

662
00:51:41,729 --> 00:51:43,287
Fine, done.

663
00:51:43,397 --> 00:51:45,558
Give me that black lieutenant
that did Barksdale.

664
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:48,965
Daniels put in his papers.
He's gone, out the door.

665
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:53,564
Did he meet the pension board yet?
I suggest you talk to the man.

666
00:51:53,774 --> 00:51:56,436
- I'll do what I can.
- Don't fuck with me, Erv.

667
00:51:56,544 --> 00:51:59,035
I got as many friends
here in the hall as you do.

668
00:51:59,146 --> 00:52:02,343
And with what I'm learning
about the Barksdale case...

669
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,941
I got all kinds of shit I can throw.

670
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:22,992
- Lock-down in 20.
- All right.

671
00:53:07,081 --> 00:53:08,878
What's up, Ice?

672
00:53:10,951 --> 00:53:15,183
- You done with that Green Lantern?
- You can read it, but I want it back.

673
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:18,350
- You hit Dee?
- Dee ain't up.

674
00:53:20,895 --> 00:53:24,262
Four hundred good cameras, Spiros.

675
00:53:27,101 --> 00:53:28,466
Who brought them in?

676
00:53:28,569 --> 00:53:33,268
The young stevedore, Niko,
and that idiot cousin of his.

677
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,448
And I think he uses, too.

678
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,381
Stefanos.

679
00:53:47,321 --> 00:53:49,915
I don't give a damn nothing about him.

680
00:53:50,024 --> 00:53:53,357
Listen, I'm paying 10 cents
on the dollar for the cameras.

681
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:55,827
We're going to clear $180,000.

682
00:53:56,664 --> 00:53:59,064
- What about Niko?
- He's smart.

683
00:54:01,769 --> 00:54:03,259
Make the deal.

684
00:54:09,977 --> 00:54:12,309
What the hell's wrong with you tonight?

685
00:54:12,413 --> 00:54:14,677
- What?
- You're acting normal.

686
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:20,182
You know what, Dolores?
I made money today.

687
00:54:20,287 --> 00:54:22,255
Yeah? What ship was in?

688
00:54:25,126 --> 00:54:26,184
Hey, Zig.

689
00:54:29,196 --> 00:54:31,164
Shot and a beer, Dolores.

690
00:54:32,233 --> 00:54:34,531
Frank Sobotka says I needed it.

691
00:54:42,243 --> 00:54:43,437
Thanks.

692
00:54:53,888 --> 00:54:57,585
- What's this?
- Your change. Or so says Frank Sobotka.

693
00:55:02,429 --> 00:55:04,829
- Sure?
- It ain't mine, for Christ's sake.

694
00:55:04,932 --> 00:55:07,867
If you don't take it, someone else is gonna.

695
00:55:18,479 --> 00:55:20,572
Your pop's a good man, Zig.

696
00:56:03,757 --> 00:56:05,554
Yo, up here!

697
00:56:22,776 --> 00:56:24,368
T.C., what's up?

698
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,707
What's going on?

699
00:56:27,815 --> 00:56:32,081
- They falling out, four that I seen.
- What?

700
00:56:37,858 --> 00:56:39,382
What the fuck is going on?

701
00:56:39,493 --> 00:56:41,927
Bad package. Hot shots.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
